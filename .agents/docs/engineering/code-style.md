# Engineering house style

This standard is the canonical code-quality policy for `pmndrs/glyph`. It supports code that humans and agents can understand locally, change without hidden coupling, and verify with independent evidence. Apply it to new work and evidence-backed cleanup; do not churn stable code or public APIs merely to make syntax uniform.

## Design for local reasoning

- Prefer explicit data flow, domain vocabulary, and invariants visible in the current file.
- Model a closed set of alternatives with an enum or discriminated union. Make invalid combinations unrepresentable when the model stays local and inexpensive.
- Keep functions total over their declared domain and make expected failure explicit.
- Retain typed semantic state until the presentation edge. Never recover state by parsing labels, messages, class names, or other display strings.
- Use classes only for identity, lifecycle, cleanup, encapsulated mutation, or stateful caches. Prefer data and functions otherwise; do not introduce inheritance for variant modeling.
- Optimize measured repeated work. Preserve behavior with independent invariants and oracles, not snapshots derived only from the implementation being changed.

## Share durable knowledge, not coincidental mechanics

- Deduplicate stable domain rules and safety invariants that would be dangerous to let drift.
- Extract the shared portion when two techniques implement the same invariant with different package-specific codecs or adapters.
- Do not couple unrelated packages merely because a few lines look alike. Measure dependency, tree-shaking, and compressed-size effects before moving code into a runtime boundary.
- Keep one canonical optimized artifact and one owner for generated contracts. Consumers reference that owner instead of copying bytes or offsets.

## Rust

- Keep portable Wasm crates `no_std + alloc` where their capability permits it. Host-only tools, compression, fixture inspection, and oracle generation stay behind explicit features or binaries.
- Treat branchlessness as a measured kernel property, not a whole-pipeline design goal. A condition invariant for a build,
  fragment, run, or other coarse unit is normally predictable; prefer one shared implementation with that branch over
  const-generic or duplicated pipelines unless a representative end-to-end benchmark proves the duplication wins after
  optimized-Wasm size is included.
- Do not make all records pay the most granular work merely to avoid a branch. Select the smallest correct data granularity
  once at the coarsest invariant boundary, then keep the inner loop straight-line where useful. Measure metadata writes,
  allocation, publication bytes, and renderer work as well as arithmetic.
- Admit explicit SIMD and branchless arithmetic one isolated kernel at a time against a scalar byte oracle, representative
  uniform and adversarial inputs, and final-artifact size. A faster scan does not justify redesigning surrounding records
  when end-to-end attribution places the cost elsewhere.
- Use maintained font, shaping, raster, Unicode, and container libraries instead of project-owned parsers when a suitable implementation exists. Project code owns policy and serialization, not a shadow specification implementation.
- Use error enums and exhaustive matches for operational failure and closed state. Convert enums and newtypes to C/Serde primitives only at the boundary.
- Add `#[repr(transparent)]` newtypes when primitive values from distinct units, identities, generations, ownership domains, or coordinate spaces could plausibly be mixed. Do not wrap values solely for visual consistency.
- Do not use `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, unchecked indexing, or truncating casts as error control flow on reusable production or caller-controlled paths. Direct indexing is acceptable after a nearby range invariant proves it safe.
- Tests may use fail-fast assertions for authenticated fixture preconditions. Build scripts may use a precise `expect` when a violated build invariant means no valid artifact can be emitted. An aborting Wasm panic handler is a last resort, not an error API.
- Treat checked size arithmetic and fallible allocation as separate obligations. Use checked aggregation and `try_reserve`/`try_reserve_exact` before caller-derived growth where stable Rust permits it; publish state only after all fallible work succeeds.
- Keep `unsafe` blocks small and adjacent to a `SAFETY` explanation covering ownership, range, lifetime, reentrancy, and concurrency assumptions. A build that enables Wasm shared memory or threads must re-audit single-threaded singleton proofs.
- Own allocations in the module that releases them. Validate exact pointer/length or handle identity and test forged ranges, repeated release, overflow, and stale ownership.

## TypeScript

- Repository-authored TypeScript and JavaScript use the single root Oxfmt configuration: 120-column width, semicolons, single quotes, and trailing commas. Package-local formatter policies are not allowed; generated source and authenticated fixtures remain excluded from hand-formatting.
- Prefer discriminated unions for protocol, lifecycle, result, and exclusive option states. Use exhaustive checks when a new variant must force downstream review.
- Use branded primitives for opaque handles and hashes when equal representations have different identities.
- Keep untyped boundary data `unknown`. A cast, `as Partial<T>`, object check, or property-presence check is not validation.
- Do not treat a package, config, registry, or callback boundary as a reason to erase types. Preserve associated types through
  generic inference when a runtime value—such as a `GlyphConfig`, technique, schema, handle, or program—already witnesses
  their relationship. `unknown` is for data whose shape is not yet trusted, not for values that merely cross an
  architectural boundary.
- A genuinely heterogeneous registry may erase its private storage type only when registration packages every operation
  the registry will need while the concrete type is still known. The registry consumes that common operation surface; it
  does not recover the concrete type. Do not make consumers reconstruct relationships with `Any*` types, `unknown`,
  explicit generic arguments, or corrective casts. If later work needs the concrete type, preserve it in a typed wrapper
  or narrow the registry operation instead of erasing it.
- Choose a boundary tool by what it proves:
  - return `boolean` for a semantic classifier that provides no useful narrowing;
  - return `value is T` only when every promised part of `T` is proven;
  - use `asserts value is T` for throwing validation;
  - return a normalized `T` when validation also copies, defaults, or canonicalizes.
- For an unknown object, first prove it is a non-null, non-array object, then prove every property the returned type promises or the caller consumes. Use `"key" in value` when presence matters and `Object.hasOwn(value, "key")` when inherited properties must not satisfy the contract; neither proves the value type.
- Name structural predicates honestly. `isNonArrayObject` is appropriate for the one fact it proves. Use `isPlainObject` only when prototypes are restricted. Do not introduce a generic `isRecord` that implies domain properties exist.
- If a consumer needs only part of a wire value, define a narrower wire type. Do not make a predicate promise a richer public or domain type than it validates.
- Classify trust by who can author a value, not by whether it crosses a module, package, Worker, language, or Wasm boundary.
  A message or byte slice produced exclusively by this package remains package-owned across those transports. Validate and
  normalize caller-authored JavaScript, third-party callback returns, and genuinely external network, storage, or
  cross-realm input once where they enter. Keep pointer, range, capacity, and allocation checks required for memory safety.
- State whether JSON-facing APIs accept only materialized JSON or intentionally apply `JSON.stringify` coercions. Bound depth and size, reject cycles and invalid values where programmatic input can exceed parsed-JSON guarantees, and fuse validation with unavoidable canonicalization when possible.
- Trust package-owned values after their producer establishes the invariant. Do not add schema walks, canonicality scans,
  duplicate-ID searches, relationship validation, deep equality, or type-recovery branches to shaping, layout, rendering,
  serialization, projection, or other internal paths. Prove those invariants with producer unit/property tests, ABI tests,
  fuzzing, and product tests. A natural failure may still throw if owned state is corrupted; do not add repeated work merely
  to detect an impossible package defect earlier or produce a friendlier error.

Use this decision matrix before adding, retaining, or testing a runtime check:

| Value authority                                                                    | Runtime treatment                                                                                                                                   | Authoritative proof                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public JavaScript input whose invalid state is expressible                         | Validate cheaply at the exported call; prefer types that make it unrepresentable                                                                    | Call the reachable public API with a realistic invalid value                                        |
| Third-party config, plugin, Codec, resolver, or renderer callback result           | Validate or normalize once when the callback returns                                                                                                | Exercise the callback through its exported integration helper                                       |
| Fetched, persisted, or externally posted bytes/messages                            | Check the envelope and the ranges needed for safe consumption; avoid whole-document validation when a package baker/schema already owns correctness | Parser/decoder tests, authenticated artifacts, fuzzing, and corruption cases at that external entry |
| Package-owned TypeScript, Rust, baker, serializer, projection, or Worker output    | Trust it; consume directly without a second semantic validation pass                                                                                | Test the producer's complete output, cross-language ABI agreement, and real caller path             |
| Raw pointer, length, capacity, allocation request, or caller-selectable work limit | Retain checked arithmetic and memory-safety/work bounds                                                                                             | Boundary/fuzz tests for overflow, forged ranges, exhaustion, and recovery                           |
| Live handle, lease, generation, disposal, or publication state                     | Retain constant-time lifecycle/ownership guards where misuse is reachable                                                                           | Public lifecycle tests and state-transition tests                                                   |

Before writing a negative test, prove a production caller can reach the tested state. If only a test can forge the value,
delete the proposed runtime guard and test the package-owned producer instead. An internal source file is not a caller
boundary merely because a test can import it.

- Treat a renderer-side reconciliation state machine as an architecture review trigger. It must be either a measured host-resource cache or evidence that the command buffer/display list is missing canonical hierarchy, ordering, or lifetime data. Changes at that boundary require focused correctness tests and before/after performance evidence.
- Renderer integrations implement the public `GlyphConfig` contract; do not give a built-in renderer a second core API. Package-owned companion entries such as React may use one explicit private construction or identity bridge into that renderer when they must create the same host objects. Keep the bridge package-private, and do not expose internal state or add forwarding modules merely to satisfy directory-layer linting.
- Begin cleanup scope before the first resource acquisition. Track each successful allocation, listener, Worker, handle, or publication independently and release it after any later failure. Either make initialization transactional or make cleanup safe for partial initialization.

## React

- Use React 19 async primitives and let the React Compiler optimize ordinary component code.
- Derive values during render when they are pure. Do not use an effect to mirror props/state, repair event flow, or implement derivation.
- Use `useEffectEvent` for non-reactive effect callbacks that need current values. Do not use render-time refs as an effect dependency workaround.
- Preserve semantic values as typed props through the component boundary; derive labels and visual tone together at the final render site.
- Keep the React layer thin. Core lifecycle and capability state belong in the framework-neutral package rather than a parallel component-only model.

## Determinism, tests, and evidence

- Encode repeatable development, build, check, test, profile, capture, and generation workflows as package-owned `pnpm` scripts. Expose maintainer-facing application workflows through short root aliases so humans, agents, and CI invoke the same command from a clean checkout; do not treat a temporary probe or shell recipe as durable evidence.
- Unit tests cover local state transitions, parsing, arithmetic, and error variants.
- Integration tests cross actual package, Worker, ABI, filesystem, and artifact boundaries.
- End-to-end tests exercise a shipped product surface with real, licensed assets when behavior is observable there.
- Use deterministic fuzzing for parsers, wire formats, and boundary state machines. Keep the root Rust version stable and the cargo-fuzz nightly isolated and exactly pinned.
- Prefer official conformance suites, independent implementations, exact artifact authentication, and externally derived invariants over implementation-shaped assertions.
- For a package-owned invariant, exercise the producer and assert its full contract. Do not preserve runtime validation by
  writing a test that fabricates an internal value no exported or production caller can supply.
- Retain a test only when a reader can name a realistic production behavior change that makes it fail. Delete tests whose
  only failure requires changing their own mock, expectation, or copied implementation; uncertainty is not evidence of
  value.
- Prefer the highest-order deterministic test that proves an invariant, keeping lower-order coverage only for a distinct
  boundary, failure mode, public type contract, conformance oracle, or measured hot-path property.
- Do not use sleeps, timer cushions, arbitrary retries, frame counts, or random luck as correctness mechanisms. A live browser/GPU lane must use causal completion signals and negative controls.
- Regenerate a golden only when an intentional source or generator change explains it. A changed fingerprint is evidence to investigate, not permission to accept new output.
- Verify formatter and static checks first, then focused tests, integration/fuzz lanes, strict Rust linting, product-level browser/GPU evidence when applicable, repository checks, generated contracts, size gates, and OKF validation. For a broad test-only deletion sweep, establish one baseline and run these checks after the coherent sweep rather than recompiling after every deletion.

## Generated code, comments, and documentation

- Review generated outputs through their generator, inputs, provenance, deterministic regeneration check, and conformance suite. Do not hand-style generated source.
- Prefer names and types that make ordinary code self-explanatory. Add comments for non-obvious ownership, safety, protocol, performance, or mathematical invariants; match surrounding comment density instead of applying a blanket comment rule.
- Give every public TypeScript declaration concise TSDoc that states its contract and any non-obvious cost or lifetime behavior.
- Keep line-level mechanics in code. Put durable package ownership and constraints in package reference, decisions as one decision file each (`docs:new -- decision`), milestone status in the checkbox roadmap, and chronology in the OKF log.
- Update affected canonical documentation with source changes. Do not create shadow plans, duplicate package histories, or a second copy of this standard.
- Keep configured lint and formatting checks in the root `pnpm check` lane so local and CI verification enforce the same React, TypeScript, and presentation rules.
- Preserve public signatures unless correctness, measured performance, or a seriously misleading name supplies strong evidence for a change.

## Deliberate non-rules

This standard does not require a newtype for every primitive, an abstraction for every repeated expression, a type guard for every object check, `.get()` for every proven index, classes to model alternatives, zero allocations, or zero comments. It does require the author or reviewer to identify the invariant, choose a proportionate representation, and provide evidence when a change affects correctness, ownership, performance, or a public boundary.
