# pmndrs/glyph documentation update log

## 2026-09-20

- **Rejected codec programs that declare more buffers than one draw binds at registration** — `validate_codec` and
  the mirrored `compileCodec` preflight now compare each program's buffer count against `maxBuffersPerDraw` of every
  capability set it serves, and `createRasterCodecProgram` names the technique and system buffers when its assembled
  program exceeds the limit. The engine previously discovered the mismatch in `compile_bindings` and reported it as
  `result-too-large` on the first publish. See [the package reference](packages/glyph.md).

## 2026-09-18

- **Added tagged stable publishing alongside canaries** — Extended the existing npm publishing workflow so matching
  `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags publish to `latest`, while main-branch pushes continue publishing canaries. Both paths run
  the package check before publication. Version bumps and release preparation remain separate changes.
  See [the package reference](packages/glyph.md).

## 2026-09-17

- **Removed HarfBuzz compilation from ordinary CI** — Replaced benchmark-local Meson/Ninja setup and Ubuntu GLib
  installation with authenticated Git LFS bundles for HarfBuzz 13.0.0 and 14.2.0. CI now provisions both versions
  through the indexed root pnpm workflow, verifies their manifests and executables, and exposes only 14.2.0 on `PATH`.

- **Moved OKF maintenance onto the pinned Node.js toolchain** — Replaced the repository-shipped Ruby validator,
  migration helper, package digester, and commit hook with tested Node modules. Digest output remains byte-for-byte
  compatible for unchanged package trees, while the hook now hashes staged package content without staging unrelated
  working-tree edits. Contributors no longer need a separately installed Ruby runtime.

- **Removed the repository-local external-agent router and cleared dependency advisories** — Removed the pinned
  `ai-cli-mcp` dependency, project MCP registrations, router skill, operations guide, and its dedicated trace reader.
  `pnpm audit --fix update` upgraded compatible vulnerable dependencies; pnpm's generated `brace-expansion` override
  closes the remaining transitive advisory. `pnpm audit --audit-level=low` now reports no known vulnerabilities.

- **Moved searched Unicode properties onto generated code-point tries** — Bidi class, line break, and script now share one
  two-stage trie generator. Focused kernels improve those lookups by 5.6–14.1×; the current-main shaper comparison adds
  67,279 raw bytes while removing 7,534 gzip and 4,505 Brotli bytes. Generators round-trip every Unicode code point and
  Rust tests exhaustively compare the emitted tables with independent range oracles. See [the package evidence](packages/glyph.md)
  and D-370 in [the decision register](planning/decision-register.md).

## 2026-09-16

- **Removed the project baker's consumer TypeScript requirement** — Replaced the exact-version compiler adapter with Oxc parsing, lexical scopes, and module resolution while preserving automatic JS/JSX/TS/TSX discovery. Existing test files cover bindings, imports, re-exports, literal evaluation, and isolated CLI baking with neither TypeScript nor Babel installed. The existing package test command owns verification; no new workflow scripts are needed. TypeScript remains development-only; public baking signatures are unchanged. See [the package contract](packages/glyph.md), [tooling fixtures](planning/tooling-fixtures.md), and D-368 in [the decision register](planning/decision-register.md).

- **Named the integration building blocks `/core`** — Renamed the unmerged `/extend` entry without changing its exports or implementation. Updated consumers, package/type resolution, current documentation, and ownership guidance. Eight direct consumer bundles retain identical implementation modules and emitted assets; seven focused package tests, strict declarations, both example-package checks, and lint pass. The isolated packed consumer now imports both the root and `/core` without optional renderer peers. The former engine-driving API remains private. See [the package contract](packages/glyph.md).

- **Moved built-in format selection to the root** — `bitmap`, `msdf`, and `slug` now share `@pmndrs/glyph` with `glyph`; their public options and decoded-data types also live there. Renamed `/config` to `/extend` and moved built-in schemas, codecs, and format interpretation helpers there, removing `/raster`. Eight direct consumer bundles retain the same implementation modules and emitted assets as the preceding package and direct implementation imports, with no gzip increase. Core-only imports retain no raster formats. Updated consumers, documentation, and existing package-boundary checks; the 11 focused package tests pass. Baking entry points remain unchanged in this change. See [the package contract](packages/glyph.md).

- **Reduced the 0.1.0 public surface** — Trimmed 239 distinct runtime export names to 149 and 40 ESM entry points to 15.
  Consolidated React components and hooks on `/react`, portable formats on `/raster`, construction helpers on `/config`,
  and shaders by backend. Made raw ABIs, host helpers, legacy assembly, shader math/reference utilities, and redundant
  metadata helpers private. Updated consumers and documentation without an export allowlist or migration tooling.
  Preserved TypeGPU PURE annotations so unused shader stages disappear from single-function consumer bundles; the retained
  functions still resolve to WGSL. Shared React, raster, and config imports retain the same implementation modules as
  direct imports. React retains its existing shared Three raster support. Fifteen of sixteen JavaScript graphs stay flat
  or shrink under gzip; core grows by 20 B and TypeGPU integrations shrink by 2,039 and 3,097 B. Wasm artifacts are
  byte-identical and all existing size ceilings pass. See [the package contract and measured comparison](packages/glyph.md).

## 2026-09-15

- **Corrected the MTSDF reference and isolated remaining generator differences** — The reference serializer inserted
  zero-length closing edges and omitted CFF contour reversal. After correcting those inputs, Inter `8` reconstructs
  identically in Glyph and native Simple coloring at 63 error samples; native Distance and InkTrap each reach 20.
  Isolated stage comparisons identify coarse winding classification and skipped protected-texel inversion corrections
  as separate causes of smaller Source Serif/Dancing Script differences. The change retains the reference fixes,
  regression tests, reproduction script, and findings; temporary stage tooling is omitted. This supersedes the native
  counts and hypotheses in the initial investigation below.

- **Reproduced MTSDF pinch artifacts from issue #145** — Current main matches the reported Inter and Dancing Script
  coverage-error counts. A package-owned inspection workflow emits native correction/coloring comparisons and browser-viewable
  reconstruction images. Native CLI default reaches 32 samples on Inter `8` without geometric distance checks; explicitly
  enabling those checks without scanline reaches 20 but exposes severe sign failures elsewhere. The package concept records
  the evidence and unresolved cause. Production rendering and accepted baselines remain unchanged.

- **Exposed MSDF signed distances to custom materials** — D-365 publishes `fillDistance`, `trueDistance`, and
  `pixelRange` through both Three shader paths and raw TypeGPU detailed output. WebGPU and WebGL2 verify channel/sign
  semantics, scale and rotation, exact fill reconstruction, and a glow outside coverage. A substituted coverage field
  fails the numeric oracle. The shared TypeGPU reconstruction retains the existing coverage API.
  Refreshed the three affected JavaScript renderer size entries; their gzip deltas are +68 bytes for direct TypeGPU,
  +22 bytes for Three, and +68 bytes for Three plus TypeGPU. Unrelated Wasm evidence remains pinned to `main`, and all
  existing size ceilings remain unchanged.

- **Update** — Moved the benchmark workspace to root-level `benches/`, updated consumers and workspace validation, and migrated repository fixtures and assets to Git LFS with historical coverage and LFS-aware CI checkout. Re-pinned size evidence after reproducing the JavaScript differences with the old benchmark root and proving that all five Wasm binaries are byte-identical before and after relocation; three previously stale Wasm hashes now reflect the pinned build. Size ceilings are unchanged.

## 2026-09-13

- **Closed ordered-only planner verification on the final cleanup head** — The ten-PR remote stack is linear and needs no
  rebase. The complete local package gate passes 736/736 tests when the isolated packed consumer is given registry access,
  Rust passes 286 unit tests plus Unicode conformance, and the sixteen-target browser conformance matrix is green. A final
  A/B/B/A against exact main pools 202 samples per revision and improves ordinary, justified, bidi, and dense-CJK width
  reflow by 59.1%, 59.2%, 16.8%, and 21.8% at the median. Generated raw/gzip/Brotli evidence also proves the cleanup head
  is smaller than PR #175 across the shaper, browser core, Three, direct TypeGPU, and combined adapter graphs. D-364 closes
  D-362's verification status without restoring an allocation strategy or renderer order buffer.

- **Refreshed retained contracts for outward measurement rounding** — Re-derived the two public paragraph fixtures after
  D-359 changed measurement publication to round outward. The only new values are the UIKit content height and the
  unconstrained Japanese CJK width; glyph topology and placement arrays are unchanged. The UIKit generator now checks
  its retained public exact-height result directly instead of reconstructing a pre-D-359 value from content height.

- **Collapsed borrowed publication bytes to one arena per root** — Engine committed/pending stages and renderer
  candidate transactions remain atomic, but the Wasm result transport no longer alternates two buffers whose bytes
  already expire before the next call. Publication, query, detached-copy, and failure results now share one reusable
  arena; the unused `outputSlot` header field is removed. Rejection still retains renderer-owned accepted state and
  forces the next engine result to be a checkpoint. The default reservation falls by one result arena per root.

- **Closed cumulative retained-edit revision loss** — The recomposed-range shortcut now yields to the existing full
  stable-identity revision scan whenever an out-of-range retained line had to be rematerialized. This prevents a zero
  content revision from committing and rejecting the following adjacent edit. A focused Rust regression, 1,024-cycle
  acknowledgement/reclamation test, and end-to-end CJK replacement/splice churn prove valid revisions, two-slot reuse,
  scratch-capacity stability, and no post-warmup Wasm memory growth.

- **Aligned same-source drop caps to typographic cap-height** — Corrected `text-top` placement to align the cap-height
  of the face that actually shaped the initial with the surrounding first-available font's cap-height, rather than
  aligning cap ink to the line box's leading edge. The shaper reads `sCapHeight` from its retained `OS/2` table and uses
  the CSS Inline fallback of `.66em` when that metric is absent. The Editorial specimen now uses a two-line cap sized
  to meet its second baseline and a slightly wider column gutter; its projected cube remains centered across both
  columns and retains the same three-draw renderer topology.

- **Repaired fresh-clone bootstrap guidance** — Made the required `mise trust` consent step explicit, ran installation and
  development through non-interactive `mise exec`, documented that matching ambient Node, pnpm, and Rust toolchains remain
  supported without mise, and corrected the knowledge-base workflows to name Ruby 3.1+ as an external check-only
  dependency rather than claiming the intentionally minimal root mise toolchain installs it.

- **Pruned retired stable-planner guidance** — Removed live integration-guide, API, fragment-placement, dirty-range, and
  package-reference prose that still described allocation strategy selection, logical-order buffers, or the stable
  planner as current. D-362 and this append-only log retain the historical decision and evidence; ordered storage is now
  documented as the sole physical plan without adding benchmark or size claims before final verification.

- **Started the accepted stable-indirect retirement** — Removed the unused stable planner, slot pool, chunked order arena,
  mixed dispatcher, public Three allocation option, Codec strategy field, render-plan order-buffer fields, and renderer
  order lookup. Ordered planning remains the sole physical-storage path. Stable glyph identity, placement generations,
  paragraph rank, batching keys, primitive spans, and draw order remain intact. Final benchmark, compressed-size,
  renderer, and independent Opus verification are still pending.

- **Restored the Codec host-assembly boundary** — Three now reaches the host-only system-buffer attachment helper through
  the existing `config/raster` assembly module rather than importing a package-internal contract directly. This changes
  no Codec bytes or runtime behavior and closes the top cleanup PR's restricted-import lint failure.

- **Finished the placement-slot vocabulary fold** — Classified the retained allocator against D-358 and removed its
  two remaining one-field generic wrappers. The planner now passes its already domain-specific `PlacementLogicalKey`
  values directly, and slot state retains `Option<Key>` rather than wrapping the same key again. Allocation,
  acknowledgement quarantine, generation, reorder, commit, and abort behavior are unchanged; all eight allocator
  lifecycle tests and the complete 321-test Rust unit lane remain green.

- **Removed the justified placement-segmentation penalty** — Kept the existing exact F16.16 quotient/remainder
  distribution and the SIMD flag scan, but stopped forcing every adjusted trivial-order fragment into one placement
  segment per cluster. Word-space-only adjustment now reuses the retained stable word/numeric-block segments and ends a
  segment immediately after each adjusted space; only nonzero letter-gap distribution selects cluster-granular
  segments. A 50-warmup/501-sample A/B/B/A over the 22k justified width-reflow case reduced median time from
  `2.067–2.077 ms` to `1.500–1.510 ms` (about 27.3%) with the same one patch and 30.6 KiB write. Ordinary and mixed-bidi
  controls remained at `1.538 ms` and `3.321 ms`. The optimized shaper grows by 175 raw / 162 gzip / 34 Brotli bytes.
  This rejects a larger aggregate-count line format for now: the measured cost was placement bookkeeping, not division
  or the existing second semantic phase.

- **Made Wasm branchlessness evidence-gated** — Added the durable engineering rule distilled from the positioning
  cleanup: prefer one authority with predictable invariant branches over duplicated const-generic pipelines, and admit
  explicit SIMD or wider unrolling only inside an isolated scalar-oracled kernel with representative inputs and
  final-artifact size/performance evidence. The current four-block justification flag scan remains the measured choice;
  the 27.3% justified improvement came from skipping uniform cluster-granular work around it.

- **Closed the line-break feedback seam** — Kept break admission on the existing exact inclusive F16.16 comparison and
  changed only measurement publication: sizes, content extents, and intrinsic widths now round outward when their f64
  authority is not exactly representable by the public f32 ABI. A pinned counterexample at 39,000,001 layout units used
  to publish one unit short and could break a word when fed back as an exact constraint; the outward value quantizes at
  or above the original content. Indexed and scalar fit tests distinguish exact width from ±1 layout unit, and a sweep
  across f32 precision boundaries proves publication never undershoots. No epsilon or history-dependent hysteresis was
  added. Host point-scale rounding remains required after external box-model arithmetic. The optimized shaper cost is
  372 raw / 223 gzip / 320 Brotli bytes over the immediately preceding cleanup checkpoint.

- **Collapsed redundant positioning specializations** — Replaced the fragment-wide compile-time justification and
  text-effect booleans with build-invariant runtime branches, leaving one positioning traversal and the same shared
  cluster/glyph emission authority. The two former constants were threaded through most of the positioning call graph
  even though they guarded only the small adjustment tail and optional effect-lane append. This removes 80 Rust source
  lines and 26,486 raw / 3,200 gzip optimized-Wasm bytes. A 20-warmup/101-sample A/B/B/A over 22k ordinary, justified,
  bidi, and dense-CJK width updates preserves exact patch counts and bytes; ordinary, bidi, and CJK medians are within
  0.3%, while a longer 50-warmup/501-sample justified A/B/B/A measures the runtime form only 0.34% slower, within host
  variation and still materially faster than main. The predictable branches are retained because duplicating the full
  positioning machine code did not buy a measurable end-to-end advantage.

- **Closed the final fragment-reflow cleanup against current artifacts** — Reclassified the surviving Rust placement
  modules against D-355 and their shipping callers: `placement_state` owns paragraph-local segments and f64
  translations, `run_local` owns fixed break-independent local geometry, `placement_slot_arena` owns root occurrence
  identity and acknowledgement-gated reuse, and `session_placement` owns the single root f32x2 renderer buffer. They are
  distinct stages rather than duplicate placement pipelines. The bounded final reductions remove a repeated retained
  segment-resolution pass, a duplicate glyph-advance field, fixed per-instance placement-buffer metadata, and the last
  wildcard-exported host Codec assembler. Non-documentation changes in the cleanup PR are now net `−4,785` lines against
  PR #175, while batches, primitives, draws, stable identity, and the renderer submission contract remain unchanged.
  Rebuilt 20-warmup/101-sample 22k width updates measure `1.626 ms` ordinary Latin, `2.248 ms` justified Latin,
  `3.565 ms` mixed bidi, and `2.462 ms` dense CJK, versus same-host main medians `3.725/3.281/3.953/2.995 ms`, with
  unchanged `30.6/30.6/35.1/96.3 KiB` writes. A ten-window hardware WebGPU dynamic-layout rerun preserves one draw and
  387 glyphs; its median window is `0.573 ms` CPU / `0.858 ms` GPU versus main's `0.655/0.853 ms`, so the CPU path is
  faster and the `0.005 ms` GPU delta is noise-level parity rather than a regression claim. Direct TypeGPU's live
  Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug callback, placement, update, and disposal gate passes on project Chromium.

## 2026-09-12

- **Deferred attached glyph deformation outside the cleanup stack** — Removed the complete attached Three
  `Text.transformGlyphs()` implementation, its matrix sidecar, material/storage invalidation, transformed measurement
  composition, and focused tests from the final fragment-reflow cleanup PR. The generic synchronous
  `Text.withGlyphs<Result>()` read still returns its callback value, and detached `Glyphs` transforms remain unchanged.
  D-357 preserves D-356 as an accepted cross-adapter follow-up design while correcting its implementation status;
  shipping it now requires separately scoped Three and TypeGPU lifecycle, storage, interaction-geometry, and performance
  evidence.

- **Reduced the completed fragment-reflow stack without changing its topology** — Classified the final stack against
  D-355 before editing, then removed the dormant run-handle allocator, completed shadow planners, duplicate visual-span
  ledger, placement-handle mirror, and pass-through placement wrappers. Shared retained-flow and gather authorities now
  replace repeated lookups and synthetic normalization paths. Instrumented Rust coverage stayed exactly unchanged while
  six overlapping tests were removed; built-package Node coverage slightly increased while 241 overlapping cases were
  consolidated, cutting that measured lane from `91.17 s` to `34.65 s`. The cleanup layer is net `−3,984` lines against
  PR #175 and preserves the same batches, primitives, draws, stable identities, placement rows, and renderer-submission contract.
  Exact-head 22k width-reflow medians are `1.483 ms` ordinary Latin, `2.097 ms` justified Latin, `3.360 ms` mixed bidi,
  and `2.328 ms` dense CJK, with `30.6/30.6/35.1/96.3 KiB` writes. The shaper falls by 7,132 raw / 2,929 gzip / 2,213
  Brotli bytes relative to #175. Three is 8,652 raw / 8,426 minified / 2,196 gzip / 1,815 Brotli bytes smaller;
  Three+TypeGPU is 8,609 / 8,431 / 2,120 / 1,601 bytes smaller. Direct TypeGPU remains −5 raw / −5 minified /
  +4 gzip / +29 Brotli bytes.

- **Kept adapter placement packing out of Codec authoring** — Removed the `{ buffer, lane }` placement target from the
  public raster-program options and confined the target to stripped package-owned host assembly. Three and TypeGPU retain
  Slug's existing `bandCounts.z` packing, while portable Codec authors continue to describe glyph-local values without
  selecting system-buffer memory layout. The declaration boundary now rejects this physical target explicitly.

- **Removed the duplicate placement-handle mirror** — Changed publications now bind positioned segments and build the
  root x/y table directly from the placement allocator's prepared assignment slice. The planner no longer reserves,
  copies, clears, or retains a second `Vec<PlacementHandle>` containing identical rows; commit and abort still own the
  allocator transaction and the session rows independently.

- **Retired the completed M1 shadow oracles** — The full 12.1–12.5 core, renderer, browser, size, and performance matrix
  is accepted, so the standalone visual-span mapper and multi-fragment shadow planner no longer gate an unresolved
  cutover. Their production counterparts and focused integration regressions remain. The associated shadow geometry
  walker and proof-only visual-span ledger were removed with them; production retains the single compact
  `segment_instance_counts` authority used by publication. This drops more than 3,000 lines without changing batching,
  renderer output, or shipping positioning arithmetic.

- **Specialized retained slot ownership to placement** — The only shipping user of the former generic run-slot core was
  the dynamic placement occurrence allocator, always with a unit canonical value. The unreachable canonical-update
  branch, run assignment/change vocabulary, forwarding placement facade, and run-only tests were removed. The retained
  implementation still preserves allocation-free same-order reconciliation, structural reorder, renderer-acknowledged
  quarantine, nonwrapping generation on reuse, and deterministic abort/retry. This is a reduction of one active
  placement authority, not a replacement allocator or a second code path.

- **Removed the superseded planner run-handle proof** — The accepted indexed-placement design retains dynamic occurrence
  identity in the acknowledgement-quarantined placement-slot arena; static LayoutRun geometry is already guarded by its
  canonical revision and stable source anchor. The test/kernel-lab-only second allocator, run handles, transactional
  binding walk, and duplicate handle-focused tests had no release, ABI, renderer, or query consumer, so they were deleted
  rather than carried as dormant production-shaped scaffolding. Placement-slot reuse and quarantine, numeric blocks,
  boundary-run ownership, batching, draws, and renderer publication are unchanged.

## 2026-09-11

- **Closed the LayoutRun browser, size, and performance matrix** — Both native TSL and Three/TypeGPU Presentation paths
  pass all 60 workload/backend/technique cells: 10 workloads, WebGPU and WebGL2, and Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug. The matrix keeps
  every workload visible, preserves its expected draw topology, and covers Editorial, 11,510-glyph Paragraph Stress,
  projected off-axis text, dynamic layout, paint effects, and rich text. Editorial retains exactly three draws and its
  64-sample median reflow spans `0.990–1.710 ms` across the full runs. Direct TypeGPU's project-Chromium WebGPU gate also
  passes all three rasters with nonzero-alpha counts `9280/7875/7497`. The reviewed size check records 1,374,150 raw /
  532,034 gzip bytes for the shaper, 233,947 / 44,210 for direct TypeGPU, 554,014 / 136,538 for Three, and 662,332 /
  149,746 for Three plus TypeGPU. The final semantic deferral adds only 554 raw shaper bytes (0.04%); every JavaScript
  adapter and font artifact is unchanged from the preceding placement-publication checkpoint.

- **Migrated the public example renderer to the retained placement contract** — The root gauntlet caught its custom
  Codec still declaring the removed direct f32x2 occurrence buffer. Its Codec now declares only stable glyph identity and
  the required engine placement slot. The deterministic adapter consumes the root-scoped placement table and resolves
  slots into its own direct f32x2 stream, keeping backend memory layout out of portable raster authoring while preserving
  the example's simple vertex pipeline. The package's five focused tests and strict TypeScript/lint/format gate pass.

- **Deferred absolute semantic placement to query and bounds edges** — Positioned semantic rows now retain glyph-local
  origin and ink coordinates plus their compact placement-segment index. Width-only placement changes preserve semantic
  content revisions and static Codec inputs; public glyph queries and CPU/plan ink bounds compose absolute f32 values
  lazily from the authoritative segment translation. Retained line copies rebase segment indices without replaying glyph
  arithmetic. The exact package gate passes all 982 tests plus Rust, fuzz, type, and format checks. Two final
  20-warmup/101-sample passes over the built artifact pool to `1.562 ms` ordinary Latin, `2.229 ms` justified Latin,
  `3.437 ms` mixed bidi, and `2.277 ms` dense CJK median for approximately 22k rendered glyphs. Against the recorded
  same-host fresh-main medians (`3.725`, `3.281`, `3.953`, and `2.995 ms`), those are 58.1%, 32.1%, 13.0%, and 24.0%
  faster respectively. One justified pass contained obvious host stalls, so only its pooled median—not its contaminated
  pooled p95—is used; the independent clean pass measured `2.189 / 2.210 ms` median/p95.

## 2026-09-10

- **Added the Vue and TresJS adapter** — `@pmndrs/glyph/vue` publishes `GlyphProvider`, `Text`, `TextGroup`, and
  `useFont` with typed `useBitmap`/`useMsdf`/`useSlug` leaves. The adapter reconciles the same retained Three objects
  through the TresJS custom renderer with private catalogue names, stable constructor args, keyed remounts, one
  default root per canvas, and reactive font readiness instead of render-phase suspension. Shared desired-snapshot
  comparison moved into an internal module used by both React and Vue. A happy-dom TresCanvas host proves lease
  balance under Tres disposal; a new `apps/tres-playground` Vite application renders every raster format.

- **Separated placement occurrence identity from run geometry revisions** — Placement slots now key on paragraph
  incarnation, exact paragraph/boundary-source/ellipsis run source, stable segment/source anchors, numeric block, and
  glyph source. A font or local-geometry revision continues to bump the owning run generation without needlessly
  retiring every otherwise-stable placement occurrence. The maintained full font-size update drops from 456.5 KiB to
  371.3 KiB by removing the approximately 85 KiB per-glyph placement-slot rewrite; its CPU timing change is within noise.
  Focused state tests prove geometry-revision retention and distinct boundary-source/ellipsis identities. Three attempted
  mixed-bidi micro-optimizations—an extra cluster-row index, deferred segment extension, and source-order row scatter—were
  neutral or slower and were removed rather than folded into the checkpoint.

- **Measured the retained-placement checkpoint against freshly fetched main** — Same-machine A/B/B/A runs compare
  candidate `8221aa87` with `origin/main` `ee56fa48`; main's shaper is byte-identical to `20942436` because the intervening
  change is README-only. Each pass used 20 warmups and 101 measured 22k-glyph ordered-Bitmap width updates. Pooled
  ordinary Latin improves 32.3% median and 32.7% p95, dense CJK 24.5%/24.6%, and justified Latin 2.6%/11.1%, while
  publication falls from 170–172 KiB to 30–107 KiB. Mixed bidi is not hidden in the aggregate: it remains 11.5% median
  and 10.9% p95 slower despite publishing only 35.0 KiB, so the final performance gate stays open.

- **Removed repeated placement-root discovery from retained reflow** — `ClusterArena` now prepares one stable u32
  word/run-root anchor per cluster after its independently usable word-fit sidecar; positioning resolves that anchor in
  O(1). The placement arena replaces one segment index per rendered glyph with one instance count per compact segment,
  so retained line copy and final slot binding operate on contiguous segment ranges without changing batches, draws,
  placement rows, or publication bytes. A same-harness A/B/B/A against exact parent `2b6d5eb3`, with 62 samples per
  revision, improves median justified Latin 6.7%, mixed bidi 1.9%, ordinary Latin 1.7%, and dense CJK 0.7%; p95 improves
  10.1%, 2.2%, 1.2%, and 0.8%. A separate 202-sample cold comparison limits the median tradeoff to +0.4%/+0.5% for
  Latin/CJK, and the optimized Wasm is 339 raw bytes smaller. The full Rust and Unicode conformance suites pass; the
  final fresh-main/full-workload gauntlet remains open.

- **Added attached Three glyph deformation without reopening layout or batching** — `Text.withGlyphs()` remains the
  generic synchronous bounded read, while `Text.transformGlyphs()` accepts an exact-length affine `Matrix4` result as
  live presentation. Bare arrays are Text-local; structured results name paragraph x-right/y-down, Text-local, or world
  space. The first result lazily allocates renderer-owned mat4 storage and refreshes material/display-list identity once;
  later updates compare f32 rows, mark only changed adjacent 16-float physical-record ranges, and do not cross shaping or
  render-plan publication. An unchanged full result or unchanged world transform schedules zero matrix uploads; changing
  one glyph while returning the required complete index domain schedules exactly one 16-float row.
  Stable-slot owner tags reset reused records, equal-count text edits reapply matrices by the new visual index, changed
  counts retire the stale result, `clearGlyphTransforms()` restores layout placement, and `measureGlyphs()` applies the
  same matrices to interaction geometry. The exact-source package gate passes 982/982 tests plus fuzz, format, type, and
  Rust checks; both WebGPU and WebGL2 node builders compile the matrix path, and the complete 56-case Three integration
  file passes. The Three adapter grows 8,676 raw / 2,198 gzip / 1,703 Brotli bytes and remains within reviewed ceilings.
  Direct TypeGPU remains an explicit proof-of-concept follow-on rather than inheriting Three's storage contract.

- **Kept TypeGPU Slug inside the eight-buffer contract and completed the indexed A/B matrix** — Slug now stores the
  engine-owned placement slot in its existing unused `bandCounts.z` lane in both adapters. Its seven raster records plus
  stable-glyph identity remain exactly eight Codec buffers; the vertex path binds the seven raster records and reads the
  shared f32x2 placement table from scene storage, with no placement texture, ninth Codec buffer, bind group, or draw.
  The focused TypeGPU workflow passes all 38 declaration, packed-consumer, shader, and integration tests; the project
  Chromium WebGPU gate renders Bitmap/MSDF/Slug with nonzero-alpha counts `9280/7875/7497`. Three pooled
  101-sample passes after 40 warmups compare the indexed candidate with exact `2094243668bcf5462cff0ac3b1f7faf52cba3b6c`
  main. Bitmap Latin improves `3.741 / 3.829` → `2.584 / 2.680 ms`, dense-CJK Bitmap
  `2.986 / 3.153` → `2.268 / 2.292 ms`, justified Latin `3.675 / 3.726` → `3.447 / 3.491 ms`, MTSDF Latin
  `4.079 / 4.131` → `2.683 / 2.708 ms`, and Slug Latin `4.031 / 4.098` → `2.639 / 2.743 ms`. Corresponding
  writes fall by 82.1%, 37.9–40.9%, 82.0%, 91.1%, and 91.1%. Mixed bidi remains the honest exception:
  `3.956 / 4.065` → `4.520 / 4.685 ms` while bytes fall 79.7% to 35,856. A measured deferred-span mutation was neutral
  and was removed; the bidi CPU regression remains open for browser end-to-end attribution rather than being hidden in
  an aggregate speedup.

- **Separated retained positioning from publication cost** — Added the maintained `adopt-position-query` benchmark case:
  it prepares the complete borrowed-layout positioning transaction, then times only adoption, retained gather, plan
  compilation, and publication while requiring a nonempty changed-width patch. On the final 40-warmup/101-sample Latin
  fixture, measurement is `0.220 / 0.227 ms`, measurement plus positioning is `1.222 / 1.248 ms`, and the isolated
  adoption/publication tail is `1.655 / 1.688 ms`; the corresponding dense-CJK publication tail is `0.973 / 0.998 ms`.
  The exact 174,440/175,824-byte outputs confirm that the next performance frontier is core publication of the aligned
  per-glyph f32x2 occurrence lane, not line fitting or a missing Three subrange update.

- **Authored normalized same-source drop-cap contours** — `DropCapLayout.contour` now accepts a validated simple polygon
  in normalized coordinates over the existing generated cap exclusion box. The generated ABI retains the contour beside
  the cap controls; Rust validates, fingerprints, stages, and projects it conservatively into each body-line band while
  preserving the existing source selection, placement, alignment, side, and margin semantics. Focused evidence covers
  exact frame-wire serialization, tapered line cuts, a mixed Slug-cap/Bitmap-body retained edit, all 330 Rust library
  tests, all 54 Three integration tests, and the strict public type project. Editorial now authors the contour; the
  refreshed Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug × WebGPU/WebGL2 matrix passes through both native TSL and experimental Three/TypeGPU while
  retaining three draws across every 64-sample reflow sequence.

- **Projected explicit Three silhouettes without flattening their concavity** — `projectTextFlowSilhouette` accepts an
  ordered finite object-local `Vector3` ring, clips it through the camera-side text plane and camera frustum, ray-projects
  it into paragraph flow coordinates, and returns the existing normalized keyed exclusion. Zero-inflation projections
  preserve validated simple concavities; declared error inflation remains conservatively convex. Seven focused package
  tests cover the existing bound path plus concavity, clipping, fully hidden geometry, and malformed caller rings.

- **Closed the public bidi/exclusion and drop-cap query matrix** — A real Inter/Amiri integration moves two keyed
  exclusions through justified LTR, RTL, and mixed-level paragraphs crossing both block bands. Every published glyph,
  bidi, ink, line, and measurement column matches a cold rebuild while the retained paragraphs preserve their glyph
  identities. The same-source cap fixture now realizes a Slug cap beside a Bitmap body as two retained raster batches;
  moving another exclusion preserves those batches and matches a simultaneously rendered cold paragraph for glyph
  measurements, cap/body caret hits, and selection rectangles. The complete Three integration file passes 54/54.

- **Retained same-length edits through drop-cap source changes** — the text-edit convergence path now rederives current
  same-source cap geometry, starts again at the first body line when cap content or geometry changes, reapplies both old
  and new cap influence through every affected band, and retains the suffix only after cursor and metric convergence. A
  focused Rust test changes the cap glyph geometry and proves the incremental line, fragment, cap, and suffix state equals
  a cold rebuild; the attached Three test changes a combining-mark cap through the public text surface and remains
  cold-equivalent.

- **Closed direct occurrence-origin and ellipsis conformance** — Gather now reads each rendered glyph's final semantic
  inline/block origin through its `semantic_glyph_index`; it no longer treats a shared compact CPU segment translation as
  the renderer input or builds a detached-copy placement vector. An ellipsis-only fragment with an empty retained source
  interval is a valid no-op before its boundary replacement emits. The deliberately re-pinned additive f32 contract
  changes only expected coordinate bits and hashes in the authenticated bidi/CJK fixtures; their measurement, glyph,
  cluster, line, and advance contracts remain unchanged. The complete public paragraph-contract matrix and Bitmap,
  MTSDF, and Slug WebGL2 product targets pass with one draw and no reference mismatch. The 68-frame advanced-shaping
  timeline retains its exact 709-glyph, 625-rendered-glyph, 63-draw structure under the same coordinate repin. Placement
  invalidation now compares those final semantic-origin bits rather than the compact segment translation; all 333
  mutation/topology cases pass, including clipped CJK edits. The final A/B/B/A ordered Bitmap matrix uses 40 warmups
  and two 101-sample passes per revision. Pooled current median/p95 is `2.874 / 2.915 ms` for 21,805 Latin glyphs and
  `2.233 / 2.258 ms` for 21,978 dense-CJK glyphs, versus exact main's `3.697 / 3.754 ms` and `2.909 / 2.968 ms`.
  That is 22.3%/22.4% lower Latin median/p95 and 23.2%/23.9% lower CJK median/p95. Each update still writes one
  174,440/175,824-byte f32x2 patch and preserves draw topology.
  The optimized shaper is 1,325,689 raw / 511,751 gzip / 393,474 Brotli bytes. The reviewed consumer graphs are 44,703
  raw / 11,682 gzip for config, 230,346 / 43,525 for direct TypeGPU, 540,499 / 133,033 for Three, and 648,878 /
  146,273 for Three plus TypeGPU; their ceilings were re-priced with bounded headroom. The focused Editorial browser
  matrix is green across Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug, WebGPU/WebGL2, and both native TSL and experimental Three/TypeGPU shaders.
  Every cell retains three draws through 64 projected-obstacle reflows; median end-to-end reflow is `0.950–1.580 ms` for
  TSL and `1.185–1.720 ms` for TypeGPU, with publication accounting for `0.740–1.230 ms` and `0.965–1.320 ms`
  respectively. Transfer-size reduction remains open because the direct occurrence buffer is correctly dirty across
  the full active paragraph.

- **Extended localized exclusion convergence through drop-cap paragraphs** — the retained exact-width flow path now
  rederives same-source cap geometry, reapplies its cut, and realigns baseline caps while recomposing a moved exclusion's
  dirty band. A Rust baseline-aligned fixture proves retained-prefix/suffix output equals a cold rebuild, and a public
  Three fixture covers explicit multi-line flow with a combining-mark cap plus an independently moving exclusion.

- **Added a shaping-safe same-source drop-cap slice without changing renderer placement** — `ParagraphLayout.dropCap`
  carries a one-to-sixteen-line span, logical side, text-top/baseline alignment, and margins through the generated Rust/TS
  ABI. The core selects one complete grapheme through the first bounded `CLUSTER_SAFE_BEFORE` edge, disables the cap when
  no edge exists, excludes its retained glyph/design bounds from body slots, resumes the same paragraph at the exact next
  cluster, and positions both ranges through the existing x/y occurrence path. Focused Rust tests cover RTL side mapping,
  safe-edge refusal, and a simultaneous independent rectangle exclusion; a real attached Three integration uses a
  combining-mark cap and proves every source glyph appears once with renderer and shaped origins equal. Arbitrary cap
  polygons, mixed-raster Editorial composition, and the complete interaction/browser matrix remain open.

- **Projected known Three bounds into the existing 2D flow model** — `projectTextFlowBounds` accepts one caller-known
  conservative object-local `Box3`, the current object/text transforms, a perspective or orthographic camera, and authored
  paragraph-flow bounds. It intersects the six transformed box planes, camera-side text plane, and six camera-frustum
  planes as one convex half-space volume, projects the surviving vertices back onto text-local inline/block coordinates,
  inflates declared projection error, clips to the flow rectangle, and returns the existing normalized keyed
  `TextFlowExclusion`. Bounds wholly behind the text plane return no exclusion; noninvertible transforms, a camera on the
  text plane, and degenerate orthographic plane projection reject before producing geometry. Four focused package tests
  cover both camera types, crossings, a box enclosing the frustum, flow clipping, and quantized no-op movement. This is
  camera-to-text-plane occlusion only; explicit silhouettes, drop caps, and live browser evidence remain open.

- **Recomposed moved exclusions only through their future dirty horizon** — Retained exact-width, non-ellipsis flow now
  compares committed and pending exclusion geometry, unions every changed exclusion's old/new block bounds and margins
  inside one region, preserves lines before that band, and resumes the existing band composer from the retained source
  cursor. It cannot certify convergence until it crosses the complete dirty horizon; afterward it retains the suffix
  only when line, fragment, slot, cursor, metrics, hanging, and boundary state match exactly. Unsupported structural or
  cross-region changes fall back to the cold authority. A deterministic moved-exclusion fixture recomposes three lines,
  retains its prefix and suffix, and matches the cold line/fragment tables exactly; all 325 Rust unit tests and the
  Unicode 17 bidi, grapheme, and line-break suites pass.

- **Exposed stable-keyed public 2D flow without adding a second layout engine** — The shared `TextFlow` model now carries
  ordered rectangle or simple-polygon regions and multiple keyed exclusions through generic configuration, Three, and
  React into the existing retained Rust geometry authority. Admission freezes exact finite-f32 coordinates, normalizes
  polygon winding, and rejects duplicate keys, degenerate rings, and self-intersection before Wasm. Region/exclusion IDs
  no longer depend on array position; moving one exclusion advances only its entity revision, and reordering retains all
  unchanged identities/revisions. Three's one-exclusion feature cap is removed, empty flows retain zero exclusion
  allocation, and first use reserves 16 entries before geometric growth. Focused public evidence composes two holes into
  three same-line slots. Dirty-horizon convergence and the broader bidi/projection/drop-cap matrix remain open.

- **Retained static glyph geometry across changed-width positioning** — Geometry-only reflow now authenticates and
  reuses committed glyph-local, raster, and effect rows for visually trivial, boundary-free, undecorated text. The single
  positioning traversal recomputes compact segment translations and absolute CPU query coordinates, refreshes dynamic
  clip/region/thread/transform metadata, and rejects any stable-id, glyph, font, or outline-membership mismatch. Two
  31-sample ordered Bitmap repeats pool to `3.237 / 3.377 ms` median/p95 for 21,805 Latin glyphs and `2.493 / 2.583 ms`
  for 21,978 dense-CJK glyphs, versus exact-main medians of `3.769` and `3.091 ms`. Every sample preserves one draw and
  the existing 174,440/175,824-byte f32x2 direct-offset patch, so the measured 14.1%/19.4% median gains come from reduced
  CPU positioning work rather than a GPU-layout or publication-byte change. The final compact offset publication and
  browser/size gates remain open.

- **Internalized Codec system-buffer layout below raster authoring** — A portable `RasterCodec.codecBody` now receives
  only the frozen renderer capability set and authors glyph-local technique buffers. After authenticating that body, the
  engine appends stable-glyph identity, optional transform identity, and the direct f32x2 placement offset through a
  package-private host step. Codec authors can neither declare nor collide with those buffers, and adapter-specific
  interleaving, attributes, or storage remain below the portable contract. Focused package and integration tests inspect
  the compiled operation tail and prove that host stores remain present. This is an ownership/API correction, not a
  performance claim; the current width path still publishes one offset per rendered glyph.

- **Skipped retained raster reconstruction for position-only changes** — Retained gather now proves that the active
  Codec outputs depend only on semantic position fields before updating those fields and CPU ink bounds in place. That
  path does not repeat font binding selection, raster resource lookup, or full `PlanGlyph` construction; any glyph,
  strike, resource, u32, topology, or non-position dependency falls back to the established gather authority. On the
  22k ordered Bitmap adoption-only benchmark, paired on/off runs improved from `4.603` to `4.467 ms` and from `3.866`
  to `3.827 ms` (about 1–3%). This is a bounded CPU-publication improvement: the complete width path still publishes
  one f32x2 direct offset per glyph, so the 170.4 KiB write and the compact-segment milestone remain open.

## 2026-09-09

- **Cut direct occurrence offsets through Codec and both renderers** — The generated semantic contract now carries
  engine-owned placement-inline and placement-block values, while raster Codec authors continue to describe only glyph
  semantics and declared raster buffers. Package-private host assembly stores one hidden f32x2 offset after the portable
  body is authenticated; Three applies it before Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, or external-raster vertex work, and direct TypeGPU
  realizes the same values as an adapter-local instance input. Stable glyph identity, batch keys, primitives, spans,
  draws, and decorations are unchanged. A
  deterministic 65,536-case arithmetic test proves the new local-plus-offset operation has the same final f32 bits as
  the former Codec-side absolute-origin addition for every admitted finite sample. Package evidence covers retained Three
  material/draw identity and static raster bytes, direct TypeGPU static-buffer retention, and 968 package tests. The
  22k ordered Bitmap width benchmark remains a performance checkpoint rather than closure: Latin measures `3.785 /
3.844 ms` versus main's `3.801 / 3.900 ms`, and dense CJK measures `3.022 / 3.047 ms` versus `2.985 / 3.001 ms`, with
  the same 170.4/171.7 KiB f32x2 write. The isolated current positioning query is `1.384 / 1.420 ms`, but adoption,
  gather, plan compilation, and publication remain `3.764 / 3.967 ms`; milestone 12.2 therefore stays active on removing
  that retained per-glyph publication cost. Browser pixel and release-size gates remain pending.

- **Withdrew indexed placement before release** — The placement-slot/session-table ABI, Codec surface, and Three/TypeGPU
  realization are removed. Although that candidate preserved batch/draw topology and reduced some write bytes, it added
  run/placement reconciliation and renderer indirection while remaining slower than the same-contract baseline. Release
  builds now publish the established absolute f32 origins again and compile the numeric-block/segment/run-slot machinery
  only for tests and kernel-lab evidence. On the exact 22k ordered Bitmap width-resize harness, the cleanup measures
  `3.953 / 3.975 ms` Latin and `3.141 / 3.167 ms` dense CJK versus same-run main medians of `3.801` and `2.985 ms`, while
  both still write 170.4/171.7 KiB. The next candidate is one direct engine-owned f32x2 x/y occurrence offset aligned
  with existing physical glyph records. Codec authors will not declare slots, tables, bind groups, or backend memory
  layout; adapters own that realization and must preserve existing batches, order indirection, primitives, and draws.

- **Isolated the remaining LayoutRun CPU regression** — Added a maintained `position-query` benchmark that includes the
  break-changing flow and positioning tail but excludes gather, plan compilation, publication, and inspection copies. At
  623 rendered Bitmap glyphs the frozen main baseline measured `0.061 ms`; the initial cutover measured `0.109 ms`, and
  compacting the shipping run-local row recovered only `0.004 ms`. Direct row addressing for source-order runs then cut a
  stable 22k positioning comparison from `2.776–2.823 ms` to `2.695–2.701 ms`; the complete 22k Latin/CJK paths improved
  from `4.067/3.650 ms` to `3.893/3.607 ms`. Embedding retained local origins into the existing 64-byte `LayoutGlyph`
  row removed two parallel per-glyph vectors and brought the exact rebuilt Latin/CJK paths to `3.864/3.195 ms`; the
  remaining gap to frozen main is `2.5%/7.4%`. A separate unchanged-publication fast path restored no-op updates to
  `0.001 ms`. Both changed-width paths remain slower than main despite reducing writes from 170.4/171.7 KiB to
  39.8/101.4 KiB, so milestone 12.2 remains active and compressed placement construction remains the primary CPU gap.

- **Corrected the external Three raster gate** — Direct `TextGroup.updateMatrixWorld()` now observes and publishes a
  changed finite group render order without requiring a full Scene traversal; unchanged traversal remains inert. The
  external raster browser proof now exercises the current root-level publication contract—`TextGroup.renderOrder`
  against sibling Scene draw order—instead of the superseded per-group publication model. WebGPU and WebGL2 each pass
  two retained deterministic frames with the same pixel hash, retained Mesh, and retained geometry.

- **Cut the retained LayoutRun placement contract through core and renderers** — The generated ABI now carries a distinct
  per-physical-glyph placement slot and one program-independent session table whose row is exactly f32x2 x/y. Planner-
  scoped run and placement slots are staged, generation-checked, and acknowledgement-quarantined; fixed numeric blocks,
  sparse word-root segments, dense-CJK segments, visual order, bidi, hanging spaces, and replacement runs remain core
  authorities. Three and direct TypeGPU resolve placement without adding a run/slice batch key, primitive, span, or draw,
  and stable glyph identity remains a separate truthful lane. This is a pre-alpha coordinate reset, not a compatibility
  mode; justification and visual metadata never enter renderer rows.

- **Measured and corrected the first complete cutover** — The maintained benchmark now declares the distinct
  placement-slot output for Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug and records retained buffer live/capacity bytes; earlier measurements
  without that occurrence lane remain attribution history rather than complete cutover costs. Compatible post-shaping
  CJK script runs now share one geometry `LayoutRun` when direction, bidi level, selected font, and shaping/layout style agree.
  On the exact placement-slot-inclusive target, 22k ordered Bitmap CJK active-resize improved from
  `4.178 / 4.305 ms` to `3.590 / 3.940 ms`, and median writes fell from 143.1 KiB to 101.4 KiB as the shared x/y table
  shrank from 58,592 to 15,968 bytes; the 87,912-byte occurrence rewrite remained the dominant cost while one-primitive
  topology stayed unchanged. The matching Latin target measured `4.075 / 4.386 ms` with 39.8 KiB median writes and only
  the shared x/y table patched.
  Relative to PR #172's older absolute-placement timings, the target median is 1.5% faster for Latin and 0.5% slower for
  CJK, but those are directional cross-contract comparisons rather than release gates. CPU publication consumes the same
  local-plus-placement f32 operation as renderers. Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug program registration is green; roadmap 12.2 remains
  active until the consolidated package/release and browser gates close.

- **Re-pinned final LayoutRun coordinate arithmetic** — Deterministic inline and normal-range block controls prove that
  additive run-local placement cannot preserve the former ordered-f64-fold then single-f32-narrow bits universally; the
  4,111-case representation lab also rejects plain f32, high/low translation, and break-anchor forms as exact legacy-bit
  encodings. Because the package is pre-alpha, the plan now selects one replacement contract instead of a compatibility
  fallback: retain 16-fraction-bit i64 fit/justification decisions and f64 shaping/layout internals, narrow stable local
  and dynamic placement components separately, and apply one declared f32 order in CPU queries/publication and every
  renderer. CPU glyph origins and ink bounds now consume the retained local row and placement row through that exact
  operation. The old absolute materializer remains test comparison evidence only; no production compatibility path exists.
  Static anchors may be fixed break-independent numeric blocks inside one LayoutRun, never visual slices. Numeric
  boundaries are independent of shaping-safe line breaks; admission uses the full running two-dimensional origin/ink
  envelope, and placement uses stability-aware source-slice/block/visual-segment intersections. Sparse prose retains safe
  word-root slots even when adjacent translations match and splits inside a word only for a real displacement or boundary
  change; dense CJK keeps large runs and uses fixed numeric blocks plus current visual segments without per-glyph rows.
  Every renderer/session placement row is universally exactly f32x2 x/y. Justification quotient/remainder, ordinals,
  class, role, bidi, and block metadata remain CPU SoA only, and every segment selects an ordinary row. No shader
  justification sidecar, renderer mode, or raster-program split remains planned.
  Local-narrow, translation-narrow, and final-add error gates remain separate, while replacements own distinct retained
  runs. Warmed dense-CJK width changes with unchanged local and replacement topology must still write zero static
  glyph-local/numeric-block bytes.

- **Gave retained LayoutRuns planner-scoped transactional identity** — Each paragraph incarnation
  now owns exact non-hash canonical run revisions derived from complete retained text, shaping,
  cluster, and glyph topology. A root-scoped dense slot arena reconciles those revisions, binds
  `{slot, generation}` only into staged cluster state, and quarantines retired slots through the
  existing renderer acknowledgement fence. Width-only reflow skips canonical comparison; paint,
  raster binding, placement, and batching remain outside run identity.

- **Staged compact LayoutRun placement below existing batching** — Normal core execution now retains fixed numeric
  blocks, stable word-root placement segments, separate visual spans, one segment index per rendered glyph, and exactly
  one f64 inline/block translation per segment beside the still-authoritative absolute output. The single existing
  positioning traversal populates both; justification state is not duplicated into placement rows. Retained lines copy
  and rebind compact metadata by canonical run revision and stable segment anchor, with a capacity-reused revision index
  preventing per-segment run scans. Boundary source and ellipsis own distinct replacement runs and blocks. No segment,
  role, or placement field enters Codec batch keys or draw topology, and no ABI, renderer, or performance claim exists
  until the atomic f32x2 publication cutover removes absolute glyph writes.

- **Started the production LayoutRun cutover** — `ClusterArena` now retains maximal shaping-compatible runs in normal
  execution. Flow extents consume those runs as their single production traversal, while boundary-free, zero-indent,
  trivial-order positioning—including justification—reuses one run geometry tuple and preserves the existing f64 pen
  sequence and f32 publication narrow. Bidi, boundary, and indent cases remain on the shared cluster-emission authority.
  TypeGPU placement must join the existing scene bind group rather than consume a fifth group alongside both callbacks.

## 2026-09-08

- **Planned fragment-relative reflow after merged PR #161** — Recorded commit
  `2094243668bcf5462cff0ac3b1f7faf52cba3b6c` and tree `1127e066a5a9681e93fc19ef400740222155498b`
  as the frontier baseline. Milestone 12 now owns an evidence-gated `LayoutRun` topology and placement cutover before
  public polygon exclusions, projected known-geometry objects, and same-source contour drop caps. The plan must preserve
  the current numeric domains—16-fraction-bit `i64` layout decisions, `f64` positioning, and `f32` publication—and the
  retained transaction, query, batching, and renderer-publication contracts merged through D-350–D-354. The earlier
  editorial-flow concept remains the Pretext comparison and benchmark rationale rather than a second implementation plan.
  This documentation step makes no implementation or performance claim.

- **Added synchronous demand-read glyph inspection** — Core, Three, and TypeGPU Text controllers now expose
  `withGlyphs(callback)` for indexed glyph reads without publishing or copying the complete semantic layout.
  A fixed private Wasm descriptor plus fixed per-record scratch keeps setup independent of glyph count; callback lifetime,
  thenable rejection, and a shared engine reentry gate prevent borrowed views from surviving or mutating their source.

- **Made Rich Text mutation load refresh-rate independent** — Its rAF hook now publishes at most one latest-state update
  per 60 Hz logical tick. The tick directly derives one continuously rate-scaled emphasis/tint state, so the 0%, 50%, and
  100% controls do not republish duplicate content or replay skipped intermediate states. High-refresh duplicate frames,
  disabled animation, and delayed-frame catch-up add no work.

- **Corrected the post-TypeGPU integration boundary** — Published renderer-free shader realizations as the explicit
  `/shaders/tsl` and `/shaders/typegpu` siblings, retained `/three/typegpu` as the isolated Three experiment, and kept
  `/typegpu` as the narrower direct renderer. Packed-consumer builds now prove the root and stable Three entry never
  request optional TypeGPU peers, while TypeGPU entries declare and require them. Focused Bitmap-plus-decoration evidence
  holds the custom-material contract equal across both Three configs. The physical source mirrors those dialect paths,
  each Slug leaf deliberately exports its reusable primitives, and deep shader implementation modules remain private.
  Shared Three types and config construction no longer pull native TSL into `/three/typegpu`. Package-size gates price
  `/three`, `/three/typegpu`, and direct `/typegpu`; shader barrels retain package-resolution, graph-isolation, and
  tree-shaking proofs without a redundant per-technique size matrix. No shader algorithm changed.

- **Removed benchmark-shell work from active paragraph reflow** — Paragraph Stress now applies its rounded width and
  font-size motion inside the retained scene frame hook rather than republishing reactive control state on every step;
  unchanged frames stage nothing and live attributes report the actual animated values. Editorial measures each Text
  once per reflow, and the isolated performance workflow now includes both active-resize workloads.

- **Pinned the paragraph-batching and TypeGPU recovery** — A disposable implementation plan now records the exact PR
  #46 merged-main baseline, the #128-to-#161 stack order and authorship-preserving rebase procedure, already-checkpointed
  fixes, validated correctness findings, resize-performance attribution, TypeGPU export and optional-peer gates, final
  adversarial review, maintainer benchmark approval, and the conditions for deleting the plan after landing.

## 2026-09-07

- **Closed the adversarial retained-transaction review** — Rust now indexes semantic input sections by paragraph ID
  before applying them in retained semantic order, so an atomic batch may carry valid text, style, constraint, and inline
  tables in any paragraph-group order without changing glyph records or adding work to empty frames. Three query
  reconciliation includes only render-active members plus the explicitly queried detached Text, preventing inspection of
  one paragraph from binding unrelated detached siblings. Rank-only updates no longer replace unchanged metric objects,
  and the full flow builder preserves negative half-leading for an authored tight line box. The fresh-scene performance
  workflow now requests exact finite 120-sample CPU and completed-GPU windows without changing the continuously displayed
  rolling telemetry.

- **Corrected retained-performance attribution** — Content-only Three updates now recognize the already-owned normalized
  style, layout, and constraint identities before merge, validation, deep comparison, or cloning; actual full-field
  reassignments retain deep snapshot validation. The specialized runner now strips pnpm's option delimiter and places
  forwarded Vitexec options before the injected module, with a focused argv-order contract. An aggregate main comparison
  was rejected because main retained its telemetry ring across workload replacement; fresh-page profiles instead show
  Off-axis / 3D, Dynamic Layout, and Paint & Effects flat or faster on the candidate.

- **Activated the camera-ranked label proof** — The presentation host now forwards its active workload camera into
  every frame hook, allowing Camera Billboard to orbit, face the camera, and rewrite child `Text.renderOrder` ranks as
  depth crosses. Its reusable rank records remove per-label frame allocation. A focused regression proves both camera
  motion and rank reversal; the change is benchmark-host plumbing and does not alter Glyph records or renderer kernels.

- **Split retained invalidation by data ownership** — Plain string edits now reuse their configured and planner binding
  leases, publish only changed text plus root-style coverage when length changes, and omit unchanged lifecycle/order and
  geometry tables. Rust now limits implicit paragraph inference to an empty planner, so a content batch can update
  several existing paragraphs without dummy lifecycle upserts. The 684-label request shrank from 209,448 to 23,400
  bytes; three fresh exact-main medians of 24.24–25.87 ms compare with final post-review medians of 11.39–11.89 ms on
  the candidate, with one draw and 5,362 glyphs throughout. Configured
  roots now prewarm one 64-unit spare paragraph rather than 256, saving roughly 462 KiB/root in the isolated cold probe,
  while active paragraph arenas continue growing from actual content without a root-wide publication scan. The scoped
  maintainability review additionally corrected style-limit accounting to use style dirtiness, made Three's nested
  authored properties owned snapshots, removed one dead reserve method, and made unchanged plain strings true no-ops.

- **Completed the scoped maintainability pass** — Strict TypeScript, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Rustfmt, and Clippy checks cover the
  touched Glyph and benchmark boundaries. Camera-rank updates no longer allocate temporary paragraph-order objects,
  the telemetry ring owns one shared index calculation, and scalar word fitting explicitly disables monotonic chunk
  skips for the rare negative-advance/sidecar-overflow case. The review deliberately keeps paragraph scratch records
  separate from the 64-byte glyph record, keeps renderer reconciliation loops allocation-free, and rejects broader
  abstraction or scope-ID recycling without a measured failure mode.

- **Closed the final Opus review findings** — The second read-only review found an unstated group leaking child paragraph
  ranks into Three material keys, retained lines dropping decoration records, scalar word fallback disagreeing with the
  sparse index on negative advances, an end-aligned semantic-extent reuse hole, and an extreme tight-line-height clamp.
  Focused regressions now keep default groups in one draw, copy per-line decoration slices, make both word fitters select
  the same completed shaped segment, invalidate moved slot starts, and preserve an authored 0.5-em line box. The timed
  demo observer also records attribute old values so batched DOM mutations cannot hide a language-case transition.

- **Opened optional language-resource follow-up** — [#163](https://github.com/pmndrs/glyph/issues/163) specifies
  explicit language selection, dynamically imported dictionary/hyphenation data, a versioned bounds-checked Wasm
  linear-memory ABI, deterministic baseline fallback, and package-size/hot-path gates. Baseline word wrapping remains
  Unicode UAX #14 constrained by grapheme and shaping safety; it does not pretend to provide locale tailoring.

- **Repaired the complete timed Presentation proof** — Exact remote main and the candidate both exposed a state race:
  timed playback initialized Advanced Shaping as automatic, then the location transition overwrote it with manual mode,
  repeating only the first CJK case. Playback-aware initialization now preserves auto mode, and the probe records DOM
  mutations across the whole scene rather than polling short cases sequentially. WebGPU and forced WebGL2 both render
  every advanced case and complete the ten-scene retained-canvas sequence.

- **Completed retained word flow and width-only positioning reuse** — Sparse prose now retains one 12-byte cumulative
  record per word opportunity while dense CJK stays on the existing cluster/chunk path. Whole shaped words, including
  negative positioning adjustments and shrinkable spaces, are evaluated before a break. Unchanged start-aligned lines
  reuse their committed positioned SoA slices; the 22,000-glyph 500-update A/B moved from 0.314/4.417 to
  0.171/3.058 ms median/p95 against exact remote main without changing output.

- **Closed benchmark and query evidence gaps** — Scene-local telemetry resets retained globally unique frame IDs and
  fixed wrapped-ring extrema/copy indexing. All 60 backend/technique/workload cells preserve their expected topology,
  all 24 mutation live probes reach a visible frame, and Paragraph Stress remains one draw with flat-or-better measured
  CPU/GPU work. Large alternating glyph-inspection queries now grow the capacity reported by the actual failing A/B slot.

- **Made justification consume completed shaped words** — Editorial non-final lines now reach the exact column edge
  under the same word-space shrink contract used during fitting, while final lines remain ragged. The regression covers
  a shaped word whose early positive advance is canceled by a later negative adjustment instead of moving that fitting
  word to the next line.

- **Recovered paragraph batching without rank-packed glyph keys** — Compatible spans and grouped paragraphs again
  coalesce by resource, material, and fixed paint layer. `Text.renderOrder` ranks paragraphs only inside a `TextGroup`,
  while group and standalone Text render order remain Three draw-mesh state. Rank-only changes publish one lifecycle
  permutation without semantic or measurement payloads. The complete Bitmap/MSDF/Slug WebGPU/WebGL2 matrix restored
  Icon Grid from 476 to 2 draws and Rich Text from 36 to 5 without changing the other workloads' 1–3 draw envelopes.

- **Made explicit line height authoritative across font fallback** — Line extents now use the stack primary's metrics,
  accept negative half-leading for tight authored values, and reuse resolved extents across repeated cluster styles. A
  compiled primary-versus-fallback regression and public Inter-to-Amiri measurement both hold `lineHeight: 0.92` at 0.92
  em; the live 11,510-glyph Paragraph Stress update-and-measure path measured 1.94 ms p95.

## 2026-09-04

- **Captured the disposable alpha fast-follow** — Recorded the deferred Rust audit and remaining TypeScript
  production-review leads as a post-merge execution prompt. The brief requires revalidation and maintainer approval before
  implementation, preserves the zero-allocation and trusted-internal-data laws, and must be deleted when the accepted work
  is complete.

- **Made packed decoration shifts explicitly unsigned** — Decoration color decoding now uses TypeGPU's unsigned right-shift operator for its `u32` packed color operand, removing deprecated signed-shift syntax while preserving the emitted WGSL bit extraction.

- **Normalized Bitmap texture dimensions across shader backends** — GLSL reports an array texture's size as signed `(width, height, layers)`, while WGSL reports only an unsigned `(width, height)`. The shared bounds helper now accepts a two-component float extent, so Three can discard GLSL's layer count and normalize WGSL's unsigned result before the TypeGPU bridge; each resource boundary converts the bounded coordinate to the integer type its texel load requires.

- **Lowered Bitmap array loads through Three's backend boundary** — The Three adapter now delegates its physical texel load to the installed TSL `textureLoad(...).depth(...)` node. WebGL therefore receives `texelFetch` with an `ivec3(x, y, layer)` coordinate and explicit LOD, while WebGPU retains its native array-texture load. Canonical TypeGPU helpers still own bounded coordinate resolution and paint.

## 2026-09-03

- **Retired stale renderer vocabulary** — Marked the Rust layout proposal and Fallow duplication audit as historical,
  routed readers to the accepted GlyphConfig contract, and aligned the renderer guide and indexes with Codec,
  command-view, renderer, and raster-format terminology.

- **Trusted constraint-region partitions** — A public two-Text request now includes both a one-region paragraph and a
  two-column paragraph and proves their region spans form the exact contiguous planner partition with no resume region.
  Rust no longer pre-validates that package-owned relationship before consuming the already memory-bounded region table.

- **Trusted region and transform identities** — Removed the Rust request reader's quadratic duplicate-region scan and
  redundant nonzero checks over package-minted region and transform identities. The public two-Text Three integration
  captures both regions from the real planner request and proves their identities are distinct and their transforms are
  live; caller-authored geometry and memory-safety checks remain.

- **Trusted constraint ownership identities** — The Rust request reader no longer rechecks planner-owned paragraph IDs or
  performs a quadratic duplicate search over flow-thread IDs. The public two-Text Three producer proof now binds each
  real constraint to its paragraph mutation and pins distinct nonzero flow-thread identities; caller-authored layout,
  typography, work-limit, and raw-memory checks remain.

- **Trusted planner-owned paragraph identity** — The Rust request reader no longer performs quadratic duplicate-ID and
  duplicate-order scans over paragraph mutations or rechecks that package-minted paragraph IDs are nonzero. The public
  two-Text Three integration now captures the real retained-planner Wasm request and proves unique nonzero identities in
  exact scene order; structural ABI, opcode, reserved-byte, removal-record, memory-safety, and work-limit checks remain.

- **Narrowed wildcard config leaves to integrator-owned operations** — Raster-format lookup, portable-resource identity,
  compiled Codec-body authentication, system-lane normalization, and Glyph's reserved built-in raster registration bypass
  moved under package-private state. Custom renderer integrations keep the portable registration and capability helpers
  they can meaningfully author, and declaration boundaries now reject every privileged helper.

- **Narrowed Codec identity authoring to the actual DSL** — `/config/codec` now exposes only buffer, technique, program,
  and baked-resource identity helpers. Handle-scoped Codec, font, root-planning, paragraph, style, material, layout, and
  live-resource identities moved under package-private engine state, along with capability-set wire selection. Exact
  membership in the already-compiled Codec descriptor replaces a redundant second validation pass.

- **Closed the raw command-projection surface** — GlyphConfig integrations now receive only the renderer-bound
  `CommandBufferView` through `GlyphRenderer.decode`. The borrowed Rust publication, typed command tree, projector, and
  publication transaction moved behind the package boundary; the public closed `GlyphInstanceKind` union retains the
  semantic display-list vocabulary without exposing numeric wire identities or a second decoder API.

- **Closed the source-condition Three root backdoor** — Public Three handles and terminal roots now expose only retained
  Text/TextGroup construction, identity/lifecycle, counts, and mutable material presentation. Renderer draw roots,
  discovered Scenes, root services, command boundaries, and Font lease acquisition moved behind package-private host
  identity; explicit export-map denials keep those implementation leaves unavailable to source and packed consumers.

- **Separated Three's public registration DSL from its registry engine** — The direct plan-program leaf now exposes only
  custom-raster registration types, input validation, and stable Codec metadata. Compiled snapshots and lifecycle state
  moved under `/three/internal`, mixed implementation leaves are exact-denied, and an unused retained-geometry validation
  pass was deleted instead of carried forward.

- **Made GlyphConfig construction data-only** — `defineGlyphConfig()` now returns inert structural data, and
  `glyph.handle(name, config)` passes it directly into package-private construction. The public config leaf no longer
  leaks an invocation helper or callable factory property, while Vite-style spread/wrapped overrides keep working.

- **Kept textures out of GLSL function parameters** — Bitmap's Three adapter now captures its array texture at the resource boundary and shares only the canonical bounded-texel coordinate helper with direct TypeGPU. Its emitted GLSL calls `texelFetch` without declaring TypeGPU's texture schema syntax as a function parameter, while WGSL retains the public resource-polymorphic coverage helper.

- **Restored MTSDF paragraph orientation** — The canonical TypeGPU MTSDF vertex stage now converts the engine's downward paragraph Y into Three's upward Y, matching Bitmap, Slug, decoration, and the previous native TSL realization. A numeric regression pins the asymmetric origin and quad offset so a whole-paragraph mirror cannot pass unnoticed.

## 2026-09-02

- **Retired the duplicate public font-loader story** — `glyph.fontFace()` now owns the only application loading path and
  static bake discovery. Root and `/config` no longer export `loadFont`, `FontLibrary`, `createFontLibrary`, `defineFont`,
  or font tokens. Renderer-free Paragraph accepts a loaded explicit FontFace selection and owns an independent immutable
  Font lease, while configured handles resolve omitted defaults through `GlyphConfig.fonts`. Focused package tests retain
  private loader access only when they prove the underlying resource graph; benchmark transport and timing injection is
  confined to one harness-owned module.

- **Removed the full validator from runtime baking** — The runtime OTF/TTF Worker now trusts the core and raster GLBs
  produced by Glyph's own bakers, reading only the GLB envelope, reserved extension identity, compatible versions, and
  ranges required to pass core metadata into raster baking and composition. Node `/bake` explicitly supplies the full
  schema/Khronos validator at the same two pipeline checkpoints, so authoring and CI validation are unchanged. A size
  graph boundary now rejects `validator`, AJV, or `gltf-validator` in the Worker's initial graph. The Worker fell from
  784,513 to 50,412 raw bytes and from 146,042 to 10,437 gzip; the independent validator leaf remains unchanged. The
  post-change 33-cell Chromium/WebGPU sweep again rendered every workload on first visit with nonzero glyphs and draws,
  zero slow frames, Rich Text at 36 draws and 0.475–0.53 ms CPU submit, and Icon Grid at two draws and 0.125–0.155 ms.

- **Removed the last single-root publication fallback** — Internal planners no longer expose a direct `publish()` path,
  and their Wasm transport no longer exposes a matching one-root `update()` or owned-copy escape hatch. Every renderer
  publication now enters through `glyph.shape()`'s staged engine-wide batch and is consumed as a synchronous borrowed
  `CommandBufferView`. The renderer-facing lifetime test now proves lazy command access expires after `decode` returns,
  while Rust's focused engine test remains the authority for monotonic renderer-fence acknowledgement. The real 33-cell
  Chromium/WebGPU Presentation sweep rendered every workload on first visit with nonzero glyphs and draws, zero slow
  frames, Rich Text at 36 draws and 0.49–0.53 ms CPU submit, and Icon Grid at two draws and 0.145–0.19 ms CPU submit.

- **Removed the unreachable owned render-plan pipeline** — Configured handles now retain only the synchronous borrowed
  publication path used by `glyph.shape()`, Three, R3F, and the example renderer. The deleted alternative copied every
  Wasm publication, eagerly built a second payload manifest, awaited a renderer Promise, validated the returned buffer,
  and pooled exact-size allocations, but no GlyphConfig integration referenced it and the engine-wide shape batch
  explicitly rejected it. D-318 records one zero-copy rendering path while keeping explicit FontFace Worker transfer
  independent and lazy.

- **Removed the example renderer's parallel font/publication recipe** — The custom TypeGPU renderer now declares its
  exact `glyphExample` RasterFormat and default in `GlyphConfig.fonts`, accepts a loaded `glyph.fontFace()` selection at
  `handle.createText()`, and lets Text acquire and release its own immutable Font lease. Its acceptance path no longer
  calls low-level `loadFont()`, and the implementer guide no longer invents `text.publish()`; `glyph.shape()` remains the
  sole semantic batch boundary. The exported config factory keeps one nameable `GlyphConfigFor` annotation required by
  `--isolatedDeclarations`, while the DSL callbacks, handle, roots, bindings, and format selection infer without casts.

- **Proved the real FontFace Worker boundary** — Added an actual `worker_threads` transfer through the public FontFace
  declaration API. Posting the clone detaches every transferred buffer in the sender; the receiving realm reconstructs
  and loads the exact Bitmap selection with `fetch` disabled, preserves selection Promise identity, and leaves Glyph's
  shaping engine uninitialized in both realms. D-313's remaining executable proof is complete.

- **Single-owned transferred-font identity validation** — Reduced the eager `SerializedFontFace` claim to a canonical
  safe transport envelope and non-aliasing ownership transfer. The lazy importer remains the sole semantic authority:
  it checks declared identities against authoritative GLB and dependency bytes before admitting missing graph nodes.
  Focused loader, FontFace, and fuzz tests pass, including proof that an unsafe buffer shape fails synchronously while a
  forged identity reaches and fails the lazy importer. This second reduction removes another 1,941 raw / 315 gzip bytes
  from Core and 1,941 raw / 299 gzip bytes from Three. The live 33-cell WebGPU sweep again rendered every workload with
  nonzero glyphs and draws and zero frames over 20 ms.

- **Kept explicit FontFace transfer off the initial graph** — Moved snapshot copying and transferred-graph reconstruction
  behind the existing asynchronous `clone()` and serialized-load boundary while preserving the synchronous discriminator
  and ownership claim. Initial Core drops by 2,888 raw / 1,050 gzip bytes and Three by 5,246 raw / 1,424 gzip bytes;
  package graph assertions keep the transfer runtime lazy. The 933-test package/integration lane passed, the loader fuzz
  smoke now asserts GLB-envelope safety instead of the removed validator's rejection volume, and the live 33-cell WebGPU
  presentation sweep rendered every workload with zero missing glyphs and zero frames over 20 ms.

- **Made FontFace transfer explicit and content-addressed** — D-313 adds `FontFace.clone()` as the only path that copies
  font data for another JavaScript realm. Exact selections carry only their raster sidecar and the external resources
  that raster actually resolved; aggregate clones carry every loaded authoritative format. The returned
  `[SerializedFontFace, transfer]` uses fresh full-span buffers, so transfer detaches the clone without invalidating the
  source. A receiving `glyph.fontFace(serialized)` claims those buffers and converges them into its realm-local main,
  raster, and resource graph without transferring Fonts, handles, Promises, or renderer resources.

- **Authenticated rich-text Font values by package identity** — Structural spans now distinguish live immutable Font and
  FontStack values through their private package-owned WeakMap/WeakSet identity rather than a stale public property-name
  heuristic. Real Fonts therefore enter the span font slot and never reach authored-style `structuredClone`; Rich Text
  retains its font selection after the public `technique` to `raster` rename.

## 2026-09-01

- **A raster and its core font agree through one fingerprint** — Every raster extension carries a single
  domain-separated MurmurHash3 x86 128 digest over the compatibility tuple it must share with its core, replacing eight
  hand-written multi-field identity checks and retiring the `shapingFingerprint`, `glyphCount`, `glyphIdWidth`, and
  `descriptorFingerprint` fields that existed only to be compared. The canonical form is published contract, so a
  consumer may keep its own fingerprint-to-metadata manifest, and a third-party technique stamps it through the exported
  helper. Page payloads are never external, a font declares one raster per technique, splitting is an explicit request
  rather than a duplicate-extension fallback, and no filename carries a content hash. Baking defaults to MSDF, derives a
  url-safe output name, and skips work whose artifact is already current.

- **Kept policy identifiers out of the Three material API** — D-305 makes `ThreeTextMaterialContext` a closed
  `kind: 'glyph' | 'decoration'` union. Glyph branches carry the concrete built-in raster technique; decoration has no
  technique, while the reserved `pmndrs.decoration` name remains internal to the policy and command-buffer ABI.

- **Pinned cached Promise identity to cache ownership** — D-304 makes `glyph.init()` return one `Promise<void>` forever
  after success, gives the default R3F handle one process-lived operation, and keeps one FontFace load Promise only until
  its face/handle record is released. Ready React paths still skip `use()` synchronously. Large byte/resource fulfillment
  values require explicit eviction because a reachable fulfilled Promise retains its value.

- **Finished the ordinary Glyph adapter cutover** — D-301–D-303 place handle-relative loading on the FontFace selection
  (`selection.load(handle)` and `selection.isLoaded(handle)`), keep R3F provider/context optional and immutable, and give
  hooks deterministic mounted-Font disposal plus Promise-returning eager preload. One material factory now receives both
  glyph and decoration contexts while Three retains separate ordered draw/material realizations. The paired
  `@pmndrs/glyph-examples` routes prove imperative Three and R3F over shared assets, and the external TypeGPU proof now
  enters only through a configured Glyph handle, including recovery onto a second handle with the same immutable Font.

- **Reduced R3F font loading to resolution plus readiness** — D-300 makes readiness the only loading branch after font
  resolution: loaded selections proceed synchronously and unloaded selections suspend on the stable `handle.load()`
  promise. A provider font map contributes local aliases only. Direct FontFace and root-catalog selections use the same
  path; only an unresolvable name throws before the readiness check.

- **Made loaded R3F FontFace use synchronous** — D-299 requires React to check `handle.isLoaded(selection)` before
  conditionally calling React 19 `use(handle.load(selection))`. The graph publishes the complete decoded selection and
  face lease before fulfilling the stable Promise, so the resolved render skips `use()` and pays no Promise, microtask, or
  Suspense stall. Every resolved unloaded selection starts the same load; failures never publish partial readiness.

- **Collapsed the planned FontFace cache surfaces into Glyph** — D-298 records that Three's base `Loader` supplies no
  cache or dependency discovery, Three's URL-only `FileLoader` cache is not used by Glyph's current loader, and current R3F
  adds a separate `useLoader`/`suspend-react` cache. The FontFace path instead makes `handle.load()` enter the sole Glyph
  resource graph; Three may observe work through `LoadingManager`, while React only suspends on the same stable promise.
  The selected format is resolved solely through the authenticated core GLB raster directory, and an external raster plus
  every resource required by its decoder must finish before the selection becomes loaded. Missing formats throw without
  filename guessing or GLB runtime baking. Generated sidecar patterns remain producer conveniences: a sidecar cannot
  independently assert technique support or serve as a FontFace root.

- **Required a content-addressed FontFace dependency graph** — D-297 makes family names catalog aliases and transport URLs
  locators rather than cache identities. One Glyph-owned lease graph deduplicates the core GLB by content hash, lazily
  selected external raster artifacts by their authenticated hash, external raster resources by SHA-256 plus byte length,
  decoded state by content and technique witness identity, and renderer bindings only within their handle/config domain.
  Disposal releases reachability generation by generation, so one face cannot invalidate another or a mounted Text.
  Runtime baking is now restricted to authenticated TTF/OTF bytes; GLB format misses and unsupported inputs throw. Every
  completed exact bake contract remains cached in process, with CacheStorage persistence additionally governed by source
  freshness.

- **Canonicalized FontFace declaration and handle-relative formats** — The accepted call shape is now
  `glyph.fontFace(source, { family?, format? })` over one source, with generated `Font{id++}` families and a handle-configured
  default format. Built-in `ThreeConfig` chooses MSDF, while a spread/wrapped config may select another registered key.
  A single format or the first member of a format array is the default and aliases the FontFace object itself; string keys
  resolve through a handle's typed technique map, while imported techniques and requests such as
  `bitmap({ strikes: [8, 16] })` carry exact associated types and bake options. `handle.load()` and `handle.isLoaded()` own
  runtime resolution, known selections receive exact style capabilities, and family strings receive the handle-wide style
  union plus runtime validation. One GLB directory owns embedded/external raster discovery; no child source list remains.

- **Accepted the load-before-use FontFace direction** — Root `glyph.fontFace()` will infer default and technique-specific
  selections from ordered `{ url | blob, format }` sources without `defineFont()` ceremony. MSDF is the zero-config
  selection, exact technique options validate baked artifacts or drive source-font baking, and different Bitmap strike
  contracts remain different faces. One idempotent `load()` replaces preload and resolves to the same selection;
  imperative Three throws on an unloaded selection, while R3F suspends on that load before constructing `Text`. The
  immutable `GlyphProvider fonts` map supplies local aliases. The provider may supply Suspense and selective font-error
  boundaries while rethrowing unrelated errors. Face disposal releases its
  cache leases without invalidating independently bound Fonts. The planned direct CLI zero-flag default changes from
  shaping-only to embedded Bitmap 8/16, MSDF, and Slug.

## 2026-08-31

- **Added direct-bake glyph lookups** — `glyph bake --glyph-map <path>` emits a deterministic JSON name-to-code-point
  lookup from the same font face and Unicode selection as the GLB. The lookup and font publish together with rollback,
  `--check` verifies both outputs byte-for-byte, and ambiguous selected aliases fail before either output is written.

## 2026-08-30

- **TypeGPU is the shader authority** — Moved the remaining Slug shader modules under `/typegpu`, added canonical TypeGPU Bitmap, MTSDF, and decoration stages, and replaced native TSL formulas with `@typegpu/three` adapters. Resource operations are specialized through slots and schema-aware accessors, so direct TypeGPU hosts, procedural consumers, raw WebGPU-backed resources, and Three data textures share the same algorithms. Device-free WGSL/GLSL tests cover every first-party adapter, and direct TypeGPU resolution tests prove texture-free function sources.

- **Implemented planner-assisted detached glyph slices** — A committed `RetainedText` can synchronously emit a complete
  checkpoint for selected drawable glyph records without advancing its source publication or acceptance state. Three's
  `Text.breakApart()` imports that checkpoint as one independently disposable `Glyphs` group with full local/world affine
  matrices, source-aligned transforms, independent materials, original bounds and geometry, and no child-`Text`
  reconstruction. Decorations copy through their own checkpoint and object. The benchmark migration now animates those
  detached matrices instead of applying mutable placement snapshots to live text; WebGPU and WebGL2 pixel regressions pin
  first-frame handoff and same-render upload ordering.

- **Raised layout fitting from F26.6 to F16.16 units** — Exact and justified columns now retain sub-unit Three.js font
  sizes without the accumulated line-advance drift that could push bitmap prose past its requested width. Integer-fit,
  shrink, remainder distribution, and paragraph integration fixtures pin the new one-unit contract.

## 2026-08-29

- **Framework-neutral raster shaders** — Moved Bitmap and MTSDF evaluation plus the analytic Slug fill algorithm into renderer-independent TypeGPU functions. The Slug core imports no renderer; neighboring TypeGPU modules own page texture reads and bounded band traversal, while the Three host supplies resources and node-valued glyph fields through `@typegpu/three`. Native TSL remains only for the writable varying and matrix-compatible dilation path. The benchmark comparison likewise computes its signed coverage heatmap through a plain-value TypeGPU function while retaining its native-TSL baseline.

- **Build-time TypeGPU metadata** — Kept the repository-pinned TypeScript compiler as `@pmndrs/glyph`'s type and module emitter, then added a post-emit transform over staged JavaScript containing GPU directives. Published `/typegpu` modules and the TypeGPU-backed Slug host carry resolvable shader metadata without requiring consumer bundlers to transform package code; declarations and unrelated modules remain untouched.

- **Portable Slug source gate** — Added a device-free package test that compiles the staged Slug graph through both Three.js node builders and verifies unique shared declarations, both bounded loops and terminators, the shared solver, and WebGL2 builtin compatibility. TypeGPU runtimes are optional peers, so renderer-neutral and baker consumers retain no static dependency on them.

- **Baked identities no longer depend on Web Crypto** — Bake and runtime-bake producers stamp related font, raster, and
  page artifacts with domain-separated MurmurHash3 x86 128 fingerprints. Normal loading compares those fingerprints and
  declared lengths without hashing payload bytes. Build-time composition still recomputes fingerprints before
  publication. The contract detects accidentally mixed or stale bake outputs and leaves damaged containers to decode or
  upload validation; it does not claim cryptographic integrity.

## 2026-08-28

- **Enabled workspace source-condition development** — Every TypeScript package subpath now exposes a custom `source`
  condition, and both Vite applications opt into it for build, typecheck, and hot reload. Default consumers still resolve
  built ESM and declarations; Wasm remains a distribution artifact.

- **Aligned React font loading with R3F's cache and nested Text API** — Generic `useFont` now accepts a technique directly,
  while `useBitmapFont`, `useMSDF`, and `useSlug` are typed wrappers with matching preload and clear methods. R3F remains
  the sole promise/result cache; Glyph owns only abort and font-lease disposal. Nested `Text` authors inline runs, and its
  call-time boundary rejects box properties that JSX cannot reliably exclude statically.

- **Balanced retained style-mutation accounting across shrinking commits** — The pending-style ledger now subtracts a
  dirty text's old published span count before publishing its replacement count. A regression repeatedly expands one
  text to four styles and shrinks it to one, then proves a valid second two-style text still fits the unchanged
  `maxClusters` budget instead of being rejected by leaked historical deltas.

- **Kept renderer oracles on the authenticated portable technique path** — Benchmark font assets now compile and read
  the exact registered Bitmap, MSDF, or Slug technique instead of cloning a same-ID wrapper to capture private decoded
  data. The validated read-only compiled-font view resolves named fields, strikes, resource selections, and portable
  payloads directly from existing binding bytes without a second raster decode or field-table copy. External Slug parity
  now fetches the core, companion, and each page artifact exactly once while feeding both Text and the independent CPU
  reference; WebGPU and WebGL2 retain equal embedded/external framebuffer hashes.

- **Closed retained renderer lifecycle and scaling gaps** — Async acceptance now validates returned transfer buffers
  against a scalar captured before any sibling Wasm growth can detach the publication view. The example target releases
  payload leases and physical geometry after the final accepted plan reference retires, preserves a checkpoint control,
  and rebuilds a caller-owned replacement WebGPU device from a complete publication without an authored mutation. Host
  opaque bindings use bounded handle maps, while retained session aggregate limits remain call-time checked through
  transactional counters instead of rescanning every text. A matched 64–512 text benchmark cuts the 512-text median from
  34.38 ms to 15.46 ms; the hardware recovery lab redraws 6,588 visible pixels after device replacement.

- **Implemented explicit font/runtime/host/session ownership** — Root font assets now outlive renderer runtimes; each
  runtime creates and owns its hosts, each host installs policies and binds immutable fonts, and each session owns one
  target, retained text batch, and acceptance frontier. The default target consumes borrowed A/B memory synchronously;
  the async target performs one bounded exact-size copy and requires the same transfer buffer back.

- **Removed raw ABI authoring and decoding from `/core`** — Policies use semantic capability and scalar names, branded
  hash-derived numeric identities, and collision-checked registries. Renderers consume resources, buffers, patches,
  primitives, draws, and retirements through semantic readers instead of generated offsets and enum numbers.

- **Rebuilt the renderer and technique implementation guides** — The durable guides now show every callable lifecycle
  step, current text mutation and measurement, resource leasing and realization, transactional acceptance, canvas/device
  topology, worker transfer, shader subpaths, portable geometry, policy assembly, raster decoding, and baking. Public
  `layout()` and `glyphs()` TSDoc concisely names possible cache-miss lookup costs, and their canonical constraint caches
  are bounded to three LRU answers so arbitrary resize probes cannot retain glyph arrays forever.

## 2026-08-27

- **Closed the ownership plan's input, measurement, and entry-point gaps** — Opus High verified the font/runtime ownership
  thesis but found the draft had hidden the renderer-neutral text mutation path, omitted target-less Paragraph measurement,
  `defineFont` bake discovery, app migrations, and target-construction cleanup, and left borrowed expiry and worker payload
  ownership unenforced. The corrected plan gives render sessions retained text handles, adds async root
  `createParagraph()` over a private measurement service, preserves existing `FontInput`/`FontToken`/`defineFont`, reuses
  the bounded transfer pool, and prevents canonical Font backing from entering a transfer list. The root remains the
  canonical barrel for portable application/provider names; runtime-driving names live only in `/core`, and integrations
  re-export only signature-required root types. Follow-up review aligned the pool with full-span ownership by requiring
  exact-length reuse, changed policy installation to consume a complete descriptor with session-owned capability/limit
  selection, restored explicit baked-byte loading, and made package-size scenarios stable across entry-point moves. The
  final bounded pass preserved renderer transform ownership through opaque bindings, restored the combined semantic-view
  request, tied async transfer capacity to session output limits, and added bounded LRU/counter benchmarks for exact-size
  pooling. Opus High's final diff-only verification at `c94f3093` found no actionable blocker and judged the contract
  implementable.

- **Moved runtime construction to the integrator surface** — Runtime-independent root `loadFont()` means applications no
  longer encounter `TextRuntime`. The accepted plan moves runtime and host construction to `/core` and uses
  `runtime.createTextEngineHost()` so the owner constructs and disposes its children directly. Core keeps `bindFont()` for
  engine registration and rejects a vague `realizeFont()` API; renderer helpers use `initFont()` only when they actually
  initialize a pooled physical resource set.

- **Kept zero-copy publication as the default target path** — `PlanTarget` consumes the borrowed A/B publication and
  accepts synchronously after renderer submission and state commit. Only `AsyncPlanTarget` receives a package-created copy
  and returns a Promise, for worker round trips or another genuinely deferred acceptance boundary. A worker transfers that
  buffer back with its correlated commit result before the Promise resolves and the session advances its retirement fence.
  No owned synchronous mode duplicates the plan merely because GPU execution completes later.

- **Accepted the font/runtime ownership correction** — The implementation plan separates immutable, refcounted font
  assets from runtime-private Wasm registrations; attaches every renderer host to one runtime owner; binds each session to
  one policy and one abstract acceptance target; and retains Canvas, device, render-pass, and GPU realization ownership in
  renderer packages. It records single-canvas, independent-canvas, lockstep, worker, and multi-integration topologies and
  requires one canonical GLB backing with internal views. Deterministic owners reclaim every engine object, no strong
  global cache owns Font lifetime, and an unreachable unused Font is collected normally, so finalizers are rejected.

- **Validated the ownership plan with Opus High** — The adversarial review found runtime and React caches that could
  become accidental lifetime owners, a host-local borrow gate over runtime-wide Wasm memory, missing device-loss fan-out,
  an unauthenticated cross-host resource-pool key, and a raw acknowledgment path that preserved a second ownership model.
  D-286 and the plan now require lease-zero Wasm release, an explicit provider-owned FontLibrary, a runtime-wide borrow
  gate, package-authenticated payload identities, target-factory checkpoint controls, target-bound worker delivery, and
  atomic lockstep preparation. The finalizer proposal remains rejected: it cannot order bound teardown and adds nothing
  for an unbound Font whose wrapper and ordinary JS backing are already unreachable together.

- **Closed the target-control follow-up** — Opus verified all original ownership findings, then exposed three omissions in
  the new target contract. Targets are now explicitly disposable so session teardown detaches device-pool controls;
  replacement-device checkpoint barriers are per session so an idle canvas cannot deadlock an active sibling; and the
  worker target resolves referenced resources into an authenticated digest/descriptor manifest because a realm-local
  resolver closure cannot cross `postMessage`. A final Opus verification reported no remaining blocker. The host's generic
  session factory maps target delivery to the correct session return type and rejects a reused target object before Wasm
  allocation. These are contract corrections, not a second integration mode.

- **Clarified host versus renderer resource ownership** — The host owns portable policy/font registrations and sessions,
  not Canvas, device, context, bind-group, material, or pipeline objects. WebGPU canvases configured with one device may
  share one renderer realization pool; different WebGPU devices and WebGL contexts require separate pools while still
  consuming one host's portable bindings. The reviewed HTML implementation report now lives durably under `.agents/docs/reports`.

## 2026-08-26

- **Core host and session ownership are now enforceable** — Registrations are claimed per Wasm instance and host,
  cross-host frame references fail before invalidating the last publication, and scoped ID provenance follows a
  successful registration. Live sessions retain their policy and font stacks; failed disposal remains retryable.
  Owned publication copies now use package-private runtime provenance instead of an exported forgeable symbol. Copying
  does not advance renderer acceptance. Three consumes the A/B borrow directly, preserves realization errors without
  retrying unchanged frames, and requests a fresh checkpoint only after explicit renderer-relevant invalidation. Malformed
  emitted plans remain engine defects rather than recovery input. Semantic measurement no longer advances the device
  acceptance fence after a failed realization, and same-session owned copies now answer `isExpired()` as permanently live.
  Owned-publication runtime provenance is documented as realm-local; worker receivers call
  `TextEngineRenderPlanView.bindBytes()` on transferred self-owned bytes instead of pretending a WeakSet witness survives
  structured cloning. That call now rejects ABI, status, and every render or semantic table framing mismatch before
  transactionally rebinding its reader. Rejected Three realization makes positioned inspection return `undefined` without
  an engine retry, and fixed-capacity candidate rejection releases its provisional stack and material leases. The core
  reference also fixes the lifecycle map: compiled payloads are portable data, while each renderer owns per-device GPU
  realization and cross-session leases.

- **Reviewed the final portability size delta** — Relative to the previous accepted snapshot, renderer-neutral `/core`
  grows by 10,875 raw / 1,745 gzip / 1,337 Brotli bytes and the complete Three graph by 10,201 / 1,588 / 1,175. The
  ordinary tree-shaken browser core changes by only 27 raw / 9 gzip / 47 Brotli bytes. Shaper Wasm grows by 1,668 raw /
  774 gzip / 372 Brotli bytes. The reviewed evidence is regenerated at the final source head and passes the size gate.

- **Final layout and renderer performance gates found no material regression** — Eight matched Rust/Wasm matrices cover
  Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug under ordered and stable allocation plus CJK Bitmap at roughly 22,000 glyphs. Across 35
  low-variance cases the median head-to-base change is +0.29%; 101- and 301-sample confirmations put the largest apparent
  changes between -0.52% and +1.39%. The Three lab retains one 12-instance draw at a 0.090 ms generic warm median, while
  TypeGPU/WebGPU produces changed visible pixels with zero idle submissions at a 0.320 ms submission median.

- **Attached text can measure desired layout before its first frame** — `Text.layout()` now creates or reconciles its
  batch after attachment and uses a non-publishing paragraph query without matrix traversal, material or GPU realization,
  or draw publication. Sequential group queries share one speculative lifecycle candidate that the first traversal can
  adopt. Detached measurement remains `Paragraph`; fixed capacity reports desired metrics while retaining the last
  accepted draw and reevaluates recovery every traversal rather than latching a rejection.

- **External-agent work now has one resumable operating guide** — The OKF guide records the pinned MCP and client setup,
  live-catalog model routing, High-only Claude/Codex default, explicit Fable and 0x Alpha mappings, background review and
  implementation recipes, the labeled pinned-CLI fallback, and bounded append-log handling. It separates process PIDs
  from provider session ids and requires authoritative result retrieval rather than treating a trace sample as findings.

- **Three font bindings now retire at their real ownership boundary** — A disposed loaded font keeps its cached Wasm
  binding and decoded renderer resources only while a registered stack still names it. The final shared stack lease
  disposes the binding and then releases those resources; direct Wasm-count coverage proves the cache does not grow
  across disposed-font churn, and host coverage rejects premature binding disposal while a stack is live.

- **Portable renderer review closed lifecycle and ownership gaps** — Capability selections now belong to one policy,
  resource groups validate exact declared member formats on every public path, and failed renderer resource commits
  dispose the provisional Wasm font binding before discarding device candidates. Host teardown preserves the dependency
  order from sessions through stacks and bindings to policies; no stale resource or binding is restored after failure.

- **Runtime ID provenance now has an owner and a teardown** — Module-authored policy and buffer constants keep the
  top-level `id()` path, while `TextEngineHost.id()` owns dynamic binding, stack, session, material, paragraph, style,
  flow, and region registrations. Host disposal releases those collision records after attempting every Wasm teardown,
  and the renderer-neutral Paragraph context now follows `TextRuntime` disposal just as the Three coordinator already
  did. The example engine no longer asks callers to invent stack or session IDs it can allocate itself; stack
  registration returns the one handle text options genuinely reference.

## 2026-08-25

- **Pipelined GPU submission is measured and size-priced** — Removing the accidental per-frame queue-completion fence
  reduced changed-frame `render()` from 0.760/1.585 ms median/p95 to 0.300/0.645 ms in a paired 101-sample WebGPU run
  on an Apple M2 Pro with a 16-core GPU on macOS arm64.
  Portable resource realization adds 17,657 raw / 2,732 gzip bytes to Three while `/core` shrinks by 51,779 / 8,426;
  the reviewed Three and first-party runtime ceilings now price those measured graphs without bundling TypeGPU.

- **GPU publication is serialized through its acceptance fence** — The example renderer rejects resource or buffer
  mutation while an asynchronous submission is in flight, derives idle-frame classification once in the recording
  oracle, scopes readback validation errors, and always closes an abandoned render pass. Its named workflow now requests
  WebGPU explicitly and proves two visible submissions, zero idle submissions, one clear-only disposal submission, and
  zero pixels after that clear. Validation acceptance commits without a per-frame queue-completion stall; readback supplies
  the completion fence only where evidence needs it. Package-local shader transforms replace a private cross-package import.

- **The external renderer now proves hardware pixels and retained text updates** — `glyph-example-raster` supplies one
  indexed GLB-like quad through the portable resource contract. `glyph-example-renderer` realizes that geometry and the
  named policy-record buffers with TypeGPU, creates a WebGPU pipeline, submits indexed instanced draws, and reads its
  offscreen RGBA target. Its small `ExampleText` façade owns branded paragraph/style/flow/region identities and exposes
  create, update, render, and dispose lifecycle calls over the raw retained session. The browser lab runtime-bakes Inter
  and rejects empty initial or updated draws, empty pixels, or an update that leaves every pixel unchanged. The recording
  device remains the deterministic CPU oracle for malformed plans and failed-publication behavior.

- **First-party plans now use the portable resource contract** — Resource declarations gained checked `one`/`many`
  cardinality and fixed-member portable groups. Bitmap retains repeated strike atlases, MSDF retains its atlas and
  pixel-range companion as one group, and Slug retains repeated curve/header/reference page groups; nested groups and
  repeated geometry are rejected at schema/compile boundaries. The duplicate built-in font-binding compilers and Three
  resource-data unions are removed, so first- and third-party techniques share one cold compilation path. Capability-set
  IDs are now compiler-assigned ABI details; single-profile frame updates omit them. The renderer guide and implementation
  report now expand every host, font, session, retention, resource, and submission call in the external-renderer flow.
  Renderer-owned policy, binding, stack, session, material, and buffer IDs now come from the domain-branded `id()` hash
  helper instead of caller-selected numeric literals; type fixtures reject crossing domains or supplying raw numbers.

- **The external renderer now separates owned bytes from device acceptance** — A retained publication may advance the
  session's convenience counter before a device accepts its candidate, so the example host now carries its own accepted
  generation and plan revision while advancing engine revision when Wasm accepts the update. A rejected device candidate
  is superseded by the next frame, whose old consumed-plan fence requests a safe checkpoint instead of latching failed
  bytes. A throw-once test pins the wire fields and reaches byte-identical buffer state against an oracle. The same
  adversarial pass replaced ambiguous resource rows with `(glyphIndex, strikeIndex)`, made Three snapshot tracking weak,
  preserved portable resource types through material creation, validates Three's reserved supplied-geometry widths on
  both declarations and retained payloads, and corrected the renderer guide and package-boundary proof.

- **Renderer failures no longer wait for input churn** — Three now validates and prepares a complete plan candidate before
  publication. A material or resource realization failure retains the engine-accepted publication and retries those exact
  owned bytes on the next frame without another Wasm call; the prior draw state remains live because the candidate never
  committed, not because the renderer restored a stale snapshot. New authored input supersedes an unpublished candidate
  and receives a checkpoint from the last consumed plan revision. The former rejection latch decision is superseded by
  D-279, and direct coverage proves an unchanged frame recovers as soon as the renderer dependency does.

## 2026-08-24

- **Raster plans now cross renderer boundaries as named portable data** — A technique registers one schema, policy-body
  factory, binding compiler, and constrained immutable resource set; each host assigns its own system lanes and assembles
  its own policy. The external example publishes independent TypeGPU and TSL shader subpaths, while its root remains
  renderer-free and performs only portable registration. The example renderer loads a real font, registers the binding,
  realizes generated and supplied indexed geometry through its own device, applies generation-aware buffer deltas and
  retirements transactionally, and submits non-empty draws. Three selects one
  renderer variant per technique at registration, validates named buffer/resource/geometry capabilities before its first
  runtime snapshot, preserves generic user materials and glyph-origin augmentation, and retains draw/geometry identity
  across updates. The first implementation left Bitmap repeated strikes and Slug grouped pages outside the portable
  resource vocabulary; the 2026-08-25 follow-up above closes that gap. The browser proof enforces matching WebGPU and forced-WebGL2 frames and
  currently observes RGBA SHA-256 `0231a1849628dbe5ceba9a0539020624dbfbbc825ff3908b10c80567a00d022d`;
  the 101-sample Three lab retains one draw and geometry for equal 12-instance inputs at a 0.075 ms CPU-side median for
  the generic path, and reviewed gzip sizes are 63,468 bytes for `/core`, 91,400 bytes for the complete Three
  integration, 3,940 bytes for the peer-externalized TSL technique graph, and 2,768 bytes for its TypeGPU sibling.

## 2026-08-23

- **A retained host can now hold the render plan without holding a hazard** — item 11 of the API surface
  audit landed as a retention and ownership protocol on the existing plan surface (`internal/retention.ts`
  is its specification; no new draw-batch API). Publications are still borrowed by default, but expiry
  is now cheap and loud instead of documented folklore: `session.isExpired` is two integer compares,
  `session.assertLive` throws `TextEnginePublicationExpiredError` naming both generations, and a
  publication the session never issued is rejected outright. `session.retain` makes one contiguous copy
  of the whole encoded result — header, tables, and patch payloads stay consistent by construction — and
  brands it `RetainedTextPublication`, so retaining APIs demand it in their types. Retaining or
  `acknowledge()`ing advances `session.acknowledgedGeneration`; in-place consumers may carry it in frame requests, while
  transactional renderers carry their last device-accepted generation separately. The engine verifies that wire value
  monotonically: retirements name the generation that makes release safe, so an
  unacknowledging host leaks retired GPU storage rather than reading freed memory.
  `readTextEnginePatch` surfaces dirty ranges per `(bufferId, bufferGeneration)`; paragraph ids are
  caller-chosen handles, glyph identity rides the policy's stable-id lane, and engine storage is keyed
  by `(id, generation)` with retirement as the only release signal. `packages/glyph-example-renderer`
  stopped being a defensive-copy stub: it imports the portable technique plan, authors its own host policy through `/core`,
  drives real `TextEngineHost` frames over the published Wasm artifact, holds retained plans across
  slots and capacity growth, watches stale borrows die loudly, and records the finding that a
  `/core`-only host cannot register a shaping font at all (`RuntimeShaper.registerFont` needs
  loader-registered state, Rust refuses `registerFontBinding` with `fontMissing` without it, and
  `createTextRuntime` lives only on the root entry) — audit item 12's evidence, pinned empirically.

  **Additive**: `/core` gains `RetainedTextEnginePublication`, `TextEnginePublicationExpiredError`,
  `retainedPublicationBrand`, the four decoded record readers, and four session methods plus one
  getter. No behaviour change to shaping, layout, or rasterisation; `/three` keeps passing unchanged.

- **A refused frame now says what is wrong, whose fault it is, and says it once** — Three failure modes a
  caller actually hits shared one shape: the caller was told nothing useful, and told it forever.
  `EngineError::InvalidRequest` stood for more than twenty causes and reached JavaScript as `status 6`, an
  integer naming no paragraph, no span, and no offset, from a `/three` surface that did not export
  `textShaperAbi.status` to turn it back into a word. Six caller-actionable causes are now separated from it
  and carry the offending paragraph and style in two u32s of the result header's existing tail padding, so the
  header size and every prior field offset are unchanged (D-267); `/three` re-raises them as `TextFrameError`
  with a discriminated `rejection` resolved onto the `Text` and, where one span owns the cause, that span and
  its index in `Text.spans`. A rejected frame never reached `markApplied()`, so the identical frame was
  recompiled and rejected on every `updateMatrixWorld` for the life of the scene; it now latches on the
  desired revision of every paragraph in render order and resumes only when what it would compile actually
  changes (D-269). An inverted or out-of-range span — the one span invariant with no correct answer — throws
  from `set()` beside `normalizedColumns` and `normalizeCapacity` instead of travelling to Rust (D-268), while
  cluster resolution stays silent and collapsed spans stay in the array. A `registerThreeRasterPlanProgram`
  call that arrives after a runtime has read the registry is refused by name rather than applying to nothing
  (D-270), and `/three` re-exports the layout types `measure()` and `layout()` return.

  **Breaking**: `textShaperAbi.status` gains `styleRangeInvalid` (15), `styleSplitsCluster` (16),
  `styleNestingInvalid` (17), `styleRootInvalid` (18), and `fontMetricsMissing` (19); frames that previously
  reported `invalidRequest` (6) for those causes now report the new value, and `invalidRequest` no longer
  covers them. `textShaperAbi.layouts.engineResult` gains `faultParagraphId` and `faultStyleId` (size
  unchanged at 144 bytes). `TextEngineStatusError` gains a `fault`, and `/three` failures that were bare
  `TextEngineStatusError` instances are now `TextFrameError`. `Text` construction and `Text.set()` throw
  `RangeError` for a span whose offsets are non-integer, negative, inverted, or past the end of the text,
  where the frame was previously rejected at synchronize time. `registerThreeRasterPlanProgram` throws for a
  new technique once any runtime has read the registry.

- **The animation API is a snapshot you can hold, and the extents were already computed** —
  `snapshotGlyphOrigins`/`setGlyphOrigins`/`clearGlyphOriginOverrides` is replaced by
  `snapshotGlyphs`/`applyGlyphs`/`restoreGlyphs` over one `GlyphPlacements` structure that addresses
  glyphs, words, and lines directly, names its coordinate space in the type, owns the identity that survives
  reflow, reports every glyph it could not read, and applies totally or returns what it did not reach
  (D-270). Two defects surfaced while porting the one real consumer, and both were invisible before.
  First, the retained per-glyph lane holds a different thing in each technique — MSDF and Slug store the ink
  box's corner, Bitmap stores the origin plus the baked strike's raster bearing — so it is now addressed as
  displacement from the plan's own rest value, which is technique-free and needs no schema declaration
  (D-267); a declared coordinate space was built first and rejected because it could not name Bitmap's case.
  Second, `write_semantic` names every field it serializes, so the five new record fields shipped as silent
  zeros until a round-trip test demanded that no four-byte window of a fully-populated record stay unwritten.
  Per-glyph advance and ink extents, per-line ascent, and the paragraph ink union are carried out of
  `positioning.rs`, which already computed all of them for its render records and dropped them (D-268);
  advance and ink extents ship side by side under names that cannot be confused, because a flex host needs
  one and visual centring needs the other (D-269). On top of the extents, `caretAt` and `selectionRects`
  resolve to clusters rather than to JavaScript characters. `glyphFlags` bit names are exported from the
  generated ABI, pinned to HarfRust by a test; the unreachable tatweel bit is deliberately unnamed. The React
  inline props type is split into `TextSpan` (D-271), so a transform or a `ref` on a run is a type error
  instead of a silently discarded prop. `commitState()` is the positive commit signal (D-272). The port lost
  its hand-written identity builder, its parallel-array assertion over six public arrays, and its
  double-snapshot staleness re-check: 271 lines to 204, with the three things it was compensating for now
  guaranteed by construction.

## 2026-08-18

- **Line breaking is linear again, and CJK paid for it** — `BreakState::class_after_spaces` scanned
  `source` from index 0 on every call, and LB16/LB17 consult it on every `CL`/`CP`/`B2`. Latin prose reaches
  those rules rarely; CJK reaches them on most characters, so the whole analysis was O(n^2) on exactly the
  scripts the repository treats as first-class. `numeric_prefix_before` carried the same shape in reverse for
  LB25. Both are now `partition_point` over an array that is built in one forward pass and therefore already
  sorted, which makes the rewrite provably equivalent rather than empirically equal. All 19,338 official
  Unicode 17 line-break vectors and both bidi conformance suites are unchanged, positions and required flags
  alike. Measured through the shipped Wasm at 22,000 glyphs over an interleaved three-round A/B: the CJK
  corpus improves 1.58x cold, 1.69x suffix-edit, 1.85x localized-edit, and 1.61x localized-splice, while the
  Latin corpus holds flat within noise (a first-pass +9.6% on `measure-query` did not survive 20 warmup /
  101 measured, landing at -1.0%). The artifact grows 121 raw / 81 gzip bytes. The regression hid because
  every layout benchmark ran Latin only; `glyph:rust-layout-benchmark` now takes `--corpus latin|cjk` against
  the pinned CJK showcase strike, so the lane that would have caught this exists.

## 2026-08-17

- **Engine correctness pass: three status-6 defects, the hanging word space, and the flag lattice** —
  A live stall in the Advanced-shaping workload was reproduced headlessly and root-caused to three
  independent rejections of valid public-API input, none of them the state machine the investigation
  expected: an empty feature range on an empty root style, style payloads allocated all-languages-then-all-
  features against a validator that requires per-record order, and a ligature-absorbed cluster left without
  its owning font's units-per-em. Each is fixed at the point that made the valid state unrepresentable
  (D-255 covers the lifecycle half). A sequence-level property gate now drives randomized-but-seeded
  interactive sequences through the public Three surface and asserts per step that valid input publishes
  and that committed metrics never disagree with themselves; reverting the three fixes turns it red.
  Separately, the line-terminating word space now hangs (D-257) — it was charged against the measure by the
  fit and assumed absent by justification, which made flush unreachable on every justified line and made
  the breaker discard break opportunities outright. Finally the prepared/pending flag lattice is retired
  (D-258): every stage is one `Staged<T>`, and stale positioning over a re-run flow is unrepresentable
  rather than repaired. Lanes unchanged across an interleaved three-round A/B at 22,000 glyphs.

- **Commit-time digest hook** — Contributors editing package sources repeatedly shipped stale
  `source_digest` pins, failing the knowledge-base gate one round-trip later. A committed, dependency-free
  hook (`.githooks/okf-digests`, enabled per clone through Git 2.54 config-based hooks documented in the
  README) now re-pins affected digests automatically at commit time, refuses when a package's working tree
  diverges from the staged commit, and runs the full OKF validation as the gate. A fallback dispatcher
  covers `core.hooksPath` clones on older Git.

## 2026-08-16

- **Integer-pen and state-machine follow-ups recorded (slice 6)** — The closing number-system audit found
  one deliberate seam (layout decisions in F26.6, the intra-line pen on the f64 advance lane) and one
  implicit state machine (the prepared/pending flag lattice, source of a live regression and a review
  finding during slices 3–5). Both are now slice 6 of the
  [integer layout-units plan](planning/integer-layout-units.md) with the re-pin cascade costed and the
  maintainability-review pass named, referenced from the package evidence and the D-254 register row.

## 2026-08-15

- **Canary publishing** — Made `@pmndrs/glyph` publicly publishable and added a `main`-branch release workflow that
  runs the complete package check, derives an immutable commit-and-date canary version, and publishes the `canary`
  dist-tag through npm trusted publishing with GitHub OIDC and automatic provenance.

- **Glyph package identity** — Renamed the workspace, public package, CLI, companion packages, Rust crates and Wasm ABI
  namespaces, discovery manifest, runtime diagnostics, repository paths, imports, examples, and canonical documentation
  from text to Glyph. Typography concepts such as `Text`, formatted text, and the text-shaper artifact retain their
  domain names. Regenerated authenticated font artifacts and reviewed package-size evidence under the new identity.

## 2026-08-14

- **Integer layout units complete (D-254)** — The scale-late F26.6 migration closed across five stacked slices:
  dense font registry, integer line fit with chunk-64 admission, the retained adjacency glyph stream with
  change-scoped invalidation (re-shape scatters, metric restyles re-scale, geometry reuses), and euclidean
  integer justification sharing the fit's Q16 expressions. Interleaved lane evidence — column-resize −7.2%,
  measure-query −5.5%, font-size −12.2% after the scale-refresh layer closed the stream's own regression —
  plus the corpus re-derivation statement, the exact-f32-extent ABI pinning harness, and the still-open
  measure-query and resize-p95 stretch targets are recorded in the
  [package evidence](packages/glyph.md) and the decision register row.

## 2026-08-13

- **uikit measurement feedback discipline** — Community integration feedback (high-frequency line break/unbreak
  flapping with CPU churn in a reactive layout) root-caused to unrounded measure feedback: sweeping 811 fractional
  widths through a measure→exact-constrain loop flips line counts at 39 knife-edge widths, and rounding the
  fed-back width up to the point scale flips zero. The rule lived only in the uikit conformance fixture's
  `roundUpToPointScale`; the integration document now states it as a hard requirement with the stable Yoga
  callback pattern, and notes the two adjacent factors at the reported build: the pre-#66 metric-topology session
  storms and the not-yet-landed 11.17 synchronous-measure cost reduction. The reported distance aliasing verified
  as expected current behavior — atlas textures upload without mipmaps under a linear min filter, and
  pixelSnapping was confirmed off by default at the reported commit — recorded as quality work, not a regression.

- **External runtime bake routing** — The third-party proof lane (`benchmark:external-raster`) had been failing on
  main: the runtime shoveled every requested raster into the Worker font-bake plan, and the Worker's embedded
  baker switch correctly rejected kinds it does not carry — killing the whole load even though the host-side path
  through `technique.runtimeBaker` exists for exactly this case. The routing authority is now one declared set,
  `workerRasterKinds`, exported from the runtime-bake subpath: Worker plans carry only Worker-embedded kinds, and
  every other technique's raster deliberately misses in the baked artifact and bakes host-side through the baker
  its own declaration names. Proven red-green in Node with the published example package (a strict stub enforcing
  the Worker's contract) and by the restored browser lane: deterministic external raster frames on WebGPU and
  WebGL2 with identical hashes. Verified pre-existing on a clean origin/main worktree before fixing, so this is a
  repair, not a regression from the stack.

## 2026-08-12

- **Column flow (11.18 slice)** — `ParagraphContentBox` gains `columns { count, gap }`, mapping the public `Text`
  onto the engine's already-proven ordered multi-region flow: side-by-side region rectangles inside the exact
  content-box width, filled in order without balancing. The column height is the flow signal, so columns require
  an exact width and a bounded height, both rejected loudly at construction; column zero keeps the paragraph's
  region id, so single-column request bytes are unchanged. The editorial workload becomes a real page — one
  single-measure justified lede over a body flowing through two justified columns with indent and bounded
  elasticity, batching to three draws (lede plus one clipped draw per column) over 869 glyphs at 120 FPS. The
  drop-cap exclusion surface stays with 11.18 proper. One misstep recorded: the first workload rewrite was a
  silent no-op — a source replace anchored on pre-formatter text matched nothing and reported success; the stale
  768-glyph telemetry exposed it, and the redo asserts its anchors.

- **Editorial workload (11.14, layer 5)** — The typography tier's product proof: three justified paragraphs on one
  animated measure — first-line indents after the opening paragraph, paragraph space before and after, per-span
  word spacing, word-space ratios bounded to [0.75, 1.35] with a 0.4-unit letter-gap budget, and a justified last
  line — registered as the `editorial` comparison workload and added to the presentation workload probe. The probe
  settles all nine workloads on Bitmap/WebGPU with editorial batching to one draw over 768 glyphs at 119 FPS. The
  probe's extended paint-effects soak still reproduces the known metric-topology session poisoning on this stack's
  base — that defect's fix is PR #66 off main, and a composition run with the fix patch applied locally settles all
  nine workloads with zero engine errors, so the tier and the fix compose cleanly once #66 merges. Roadmap 11.14
  closes; the decision register records the tier as D-252.

- **SIMD kernels reach their consumers (11.14, layer 4 / D-245)** — Two lab-admitted kernels graduated into
  `engine/line_kernels.rs` production consumers: transition masks now drive the bidi run scan (sixteen levels per
  step instead of a per-unit compare) and flag masks drive the justification space scan over the new
  `CLUSTER_SPACE` flag, which also replaced per-cluster text lookups everywhere justification detects spaces. Each
  kernel is one scalar function with a `cfg(simd128)` sixteen-lane prefix and a scalar tail, proven equal by
  boundary-sweeping parity tests natively and exercised on the SIMD path by every layout integration test against
  the shipped simd128 Wasm. Chunk-64 advance summaries stay lab-admitted with the reason recorded in D-245: exact
  parity for whole-chunk width arithmetic needs a fixed-point cluster-advance representation first.

- **Justification controls (11.14, layer 3)** — Justify grows professional bounds. Word spaces expand uniformly up
  to the declared maximum ratio of their natural advance sum; the remaining deficit spills into inter-cluster
  letter gaps bounded per gap, and any residue reads as an under-full line. A declared minimum ratio makes spaces
  elastic in the other direction twice over: the line breaker lends the shrinkable fraction back while scanning —
  admitting the word that would otherwise just overflow, via a new `CLUSTER_SPACE` flag stamped at cluster build —
  and the positioning pass compresses those spaces to exactly the same bound. The last-line policy (`auto` |
  `justify`) now also covers hard-broken lines. Measurement mirrors every branch through the shared
  `positioned_fragment_advance`. Proven red-green with distribution unit tests (cap spill, shrink clamp, last-line
  gates), a breaker admission test, and a Three integration segment: an unbounded justified last line fills its
  exact box, while capped word growth plus a 0.5 letter-gap bound lands at natural-plus-gaps exactly.

- **Paragraph spacing and first-line indent (11.14, layer 2)** — The typography controls begin steering layout:
  `spaceBefore` shifts a thread's first band exactly once where the paragraph truly starts (resumed threads and
  region breaks swallow it, matching fragmentation convention), `spaceAfter` rides every block measurement so
  consumers stack paragraphs from reported extents, and `firstLineIndent` narrows the paragraph's first composed
  line and shifts the pen on the paragraph-direction side — LTR pens move right, RTL pens keep their origin while
  the reduced available width pulls the right edge inward, so alignment and justification compose over the reduced
  slot unchanged. Measurements mirror both: first-line inline extents include the indent, and the intrinsic pass
  reuses the same constraint-carried values. The public `Text` gains `wordSpacing` style and the contentBox
  typography fields. Proven red-green at three levels: flow-composition unit tests (band shift, resume immunity,
  break narrowing), a measurement unit test (indent in inline extent, space-after in block extent), and a Three
  integration segment pinning exact pen shift, baseline shift, and content extents through the real Wasm engine.

- **Typography-tier wire contract (11.14, layer 1)** — Constraint records grew 56 → 84 bytes for the professional
  typography controls: first-line indent, paragraph space before/after, word-space ratio bounds (each side
  independently optional, zero meaning unbounded), letter-space expansion budget, and a closed last-line policy
  enum (`auto`/`justify`). Rust decodes, validates, and retains the fields; the raw-byte geometry fingerprint
  invalidates on any change automatically; the generated TS ABI, frame-wire encoder (optional inputs, zero
  defaults), and record-size pins moved together. Behavior is unchanged in this layer — the fields carry but do
  not yet steer layout.

## 2026-08-11

- **Technique-contract review closure (D-250/D-251)** — Closed all four adversarial-review findings on the
  schema-authority stack. Policy-DSL values now carry session provenance: a value loaded from one program's input
  table throws when stored through another builder instead of silently reading a shifted input. Technique schemas
  deep-freeze at definition, making the documented immutability true at runtime. The remaining smear sites now
  derive from schemas: `schemaPolicyBuffers` replaces hand-rolled width lists in the Three programs,
  `schemaFieldTable` orders binding-table readers by the schema's declared names so a misspelled or missing reader
  is a compile error, the executor resolves draw buffers by schema name instead of literal id ranges, and the
  plan-program registry references the transform system buffer instead of restating `15`. Glyph-origin
  augmentation became schema-declared opt-in metadata (`glyphOrigin`) rather than assuming Bitmap's buffer layout
  for every technique. The structural gate now also rejects literal-width buffer builders, literal id ranges, and
  restated system ids. Every policy and binding byte golden stayed pinned — the derivations reproduce the
  hand-rolled bytes exactly, decided by the existing decoded-equivalence proof. The adversarial re-review then
  confirmed provenance and glyph-origin closed and surfaced follow-up defects, fixed in a second pass: session
  provenance is now stamped at node construction and combined in O(1) — a shared expression DAG no longer costs an
  exponential graph walk, and mixing sessions fails at the combinator itself; schema definition validates the
  caller's input first and returns an owned, deeply frozen copy, so rejection leaves caller data untouched and a
  hostile lanes accessor can never change a validated width; the size-budget notes now record the measured deltas
  (+3.5 KB raw / +1.7 KB minified per surface of real validation and derivation code) instead of claiming
  comment-dominated growth; and the package reference gained `/core` and `/tsl` rows with `/three/{bitmap,msdf,slug}`
  described as the compatibility aliases they are. The re-review's remaining structural finding — TSL shader lane
  meaning and the external example still restate schema knowledge — is migration layers 3–4 of the technique
  contract plan, scheduled with the audit.

- **Technique schema authority (D-251)** — Buffer ids, lanes, and binding fields are declared once per technique
  by colocated schemas; programs store through schema handles, the executor reads declared ids, and a repository
  gate forbids literal buffer identity anywhere else. Policy bytes proven byte-identical across the change. The
  full contract plan — shader-interface derivation, data origins including the reserved `pretext` fallback, and
  the tsdown build — is recorded in .agents/docs/planning/raster-technique-contract.md.

- **Policy interpreter tail measurement** — Driving the kernel-lab explicit artifact at controlled record counts:
  a 4-record vector iteration costs ~50–75 ns and each scalar tail record ~50 ns, so a span of 7 records
  (1 vector + 3 scalar, 282 ns) costs more than the 8-record two-vector shape (181 ns) that a tail-overlap
  rewrite would produce. Overlap would therefore save roughly 100 ns per tailed draw-span — real but bounded:
  a frame needs thousands of tailed spans before it reaches microseconds. Not wired per the D-245 admission
  bar; revisit if a workload profile ever shows many small draw-spans dominating the packing pass.

- **Policy authoring DSL (D-250)** — Policy programs are written against named semantic and binding handles with
  automatic register allocation; the four Three programs ported with a decoded-bytes equivalence proof against the
  hand-numbered fixtures and re-pinned goldens. Wire format and interpreter unchanged.

- **Core API surface (D-249)** — The renderer-neutral engine publishes as `@pmndrs/glyph/core` and the technique
  shader library as `@pmndrs/glyph/tsl`. Three's first-party policy and the Slug shader tree leave core internals,
  and a scoped import lint holds the first-party integrations to the same public surface a third party gets.
  Behavior is unchanged; subpath type tests pin both surfaces.

- **Decoration rendering (D-248)** — Underline, overline, and line-through render end-to-end from baked font
  metrics: public span `decoration` styles, decorating-box cascade stamping, continuous merged lines across nested
  spans, CSS paint order via record placement, resource-free decoration draws through both planners, and one shared
  Three flat-quad material. Solid lines only; other styles are rejected at the boundary. A same-window interleaved
  A/B against the pre-decoration checkpoint shows the undecorated fast path within noise. Closing the slice
  surfaced and fixed two defects the conformance lane caught: decorated sessions entered the retained gather path
  before falling back, stacking each update's rows onto the previous buffers, and the decoration shader fed
  sRGB-encoded paint to the linear working space, rendering mid-tone lines lighter than their glyphs. The rich-text
  probe now counts underline and line-through instances per case and pins them with the composed evidence.

- **Break-inserted hyphen contract proof (D-247)** — An exact positioning test proves any flow fragment may carry a
  boundary record with an empty source span and an inserted shaped glyph: own stable identity, the boundary text
  position as its semantic cluster, neighbor-anchored style, alignment participation, and an unaffected following
  line. The contract needed no fix; roadmap item 11.13 closes.

- **Baked decoration metrics (D-246)** — Font artifacts now bake underline position/thickness from `post` and
  strikeout position/size from `OS/2` as required metrics fields, decoded into public `FontMetrics` and probed by the
  rich-text conformance lane. Every baked fixture and pinned identity regenerated once, pre-v1, with byte-identical
  shaping payloads; text decoration itself stays a later additive renderer feature. Raw-node fixture regeneration also
  repaired: benchmark contract JSON imports now carry explicit `type: 'json'` attributes.

- **Kernel-lab SIMD admission evidence (D-245)** — The complete scalar/auto-vectorized/explicit kernel comparison over
  real paragraph arrays is recorded as shaper evidence. Explicit break-mask, bidi-transition-mask, and chunk-summary
  kernels measure 7.6×, 4.8×, and 2.2× their auto-vectorized forms and are admitted with named consumers in the 11.14
  line-planner tier; the pack loop and production policy interpreter confirm their prior scalar and explicit choices.

- **Binaryen merge pipeline and outlining verdict (D-244)** — Every distributed Wasm artifact now optimizes through
  `--merge-similar-functions -Oz --merge-similar-functions -Oz`, removing 8,248 raw bytes from the shaper and 29,214
  across the four bakers with unchanged benchmark lanes and byte-identical bake goldens. Explicit stage-seam outlining
  of the update path measured size-neutral and is recorded as rejected: the large export body aggregates single-caller
  stages rather than duplicating code.

- **Shared engine sort kernel (D-243)** — Twelve per-type engine sort call sites now lower their ordering keys into
  `u64` images and run through one retained `(key, index)` pair instantiation plus one raw-key instantiation, with the
  wide style-cascade key as two stable passes and permutations applied by cycle walking. Equal-key order becomes total
  and deterministic. The optimized shaper drops 50,579 raw / 14,458 gzip bytes to 1,109,644 / 428,350 / 337,447 with all
  tests, bake goldens, and benchmark lanes unchanged; the remaining 45.5 KiB of sort bodies are HarfRust-internal.

- **Recorded per-crate `opt-level` evidence (D-242)** — A measured matrix over the shaper (whole-`z`, dependency-`z`,
  HarfRust-family-`s`, whole-`s`) and all four bakers (`z`, `s`, `3`) proved every crate already sits at its per-crate
  optimum: size-level builds shrink the shaper by 84–270 KB but regress shaping-bound benchmark lanes 22–98%, while
  the parser-generic bakers inflate 26–123 KB under size levels and the font baker inflates 96–192 KB away from its
  current `z`. The decision register and package concept now pin these settings and direct further size reduction to
  code-shape changes.

- **Reconciled the public README and formatter-owned boundaries** — Replaced the obsolete TypeScript batch-target walkthrough with the shipped React and Three `Text`, `TextGroup`, span, mixed-technique font, Rust policy, and retained render-plan APIs. Added a compact Mermaid flow from mutations through renderer draws and stated the current third-party renderer boundary without claiming a stable TypeGPU host. Markdown now relies on viewer word wrapping. Canonical extension schemas and generated ABIs are excluded from formatting at their absorbed `packages/glyph` paths; the packaged font schema again matches its authoritative repository copy byte for byte, and the font-baker ABI again matches its Rust generator.

## 2026-08-10

- **Standardized the React entry and polished the R3F example** — Renamed the sole declarative package entry from the
  stale `@pmndrs/glyph/r3f` path to the originally specified `@pmndrs/glyph/react` path; React Three Fiber remains the
  internal host reconciler and an optional peer rather than part of the public name. The hello-world example preloads
  each multi-raster asset through the public hook cache, renders its controls with Slug, and uses a local `Button`
  component with a TSL capsule-distance node over plane geometry. Technique colors connect each tracked uppercase label
  to a nested globe span that binds its subsetted Font Awesome raster directly instead of requiring a font stack. Each
  label is vertically centered by a shaped 44-unit line box whose extra leading is divided around the font metrics,
  rather than by an arbitrary visual offset. A clean WebGPU browser run switches Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug without shader
  errors or warnings.

- **Removed redundant warm transform scans** — `TextGroup` now consumes Three's completed scene traversal and tracks
  transform changes below the shared draw root. Camera or group motion leaves indexed transform storage untouched;
  actual text, nested-parent, visibility, reparenting, and manual-matrix changes patch only their paragraph IDs. A
  compiled-Wasm integration regression proves shared-root motion performs zero forced per-text world updates and no GPU
  attribute version change, while a direct child move still updates its retained slot.

- **Stabilized retained Icon Grid recycling** — Corrected the engine host's aggregate/per-paragraph limit split so 684
  paragraphs no longer each reserve line scratch for the entire batch. A deterministic 200-cycle regression replaces
  the former 17-update, 4.29 GB status-7 failure. Icon Grid now scrolls through its camera, avoids layout queries in
  renderer telemetry and recycling, publishes each recycled window once, and leaves Bitmap pixel snapping opt-in.
  Clean Chrome samples on the 120 Hz development display held roughly 116–120 FPS across Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug.

- **Restored retained paragraph scaling and Bitmap CPU batching** — Metric-only style mutations now refresh shaping-run
  typography before rebuilding cluster advances while retaining the HarfRust glyph result. Optimized-Wasm tests prove a
  2× font-size change produces a 2× inline advance. Bitmap strikes now bind all atlas pages as one texture array with a
  per-glyph layer lane, collapsing multi-page prose to one ordered draw. Clean Chrome Paragraph Stress verification kept
  Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug correctly positioned at 96 px and during animated intermediate sizes; Bitmap CPU sampled at
  0.47–1.3 ms instead of the reproduced roughly 80 ms failure, while GPU remained independently around 1–5 ms.

- **Centered and simplified the R3F hello-world scene** — The public `Text` component now infers a runtime-selected
  Bitmap/MSDF/Slug font-stack union without `Text<AnyRasterTechnique>`. The example removes its probe-only effect, ref,
  frame callback, canvas attributes, redundant button-row group, and unnecessary independent-compositing declarations.
  `Text` and `TextGroup` now construct through R3F host commits, so three React `Activity` branches pre-render complete
  hidden technique layers instead of initializing them after the first click. Vitexec reads named R3F layers directly,
  proves all six hidden planned meshes exist before switching, and verifies 2 draws / 11 visible records per revealed
  technique. The controls form a centered top row and the world copy remains centered in the viewport. The benchmark's
  exact React reconciliation target retains hash `bb15bbcc`, natural/narrow layout oracles, object identity, span paints,
  and submitted draws; its explicit teardown releases the live paragraph before its target-owned font because R3F host
  disposal runs at idle priority. The example's root `bake` and `bake:check` scripts now compose separate Inter and icon
  commands, keeping each multi-technique GLB independently regenerable and verifiable. Two independent current bakes
  reproduced each asset exactly. The icon migration changes only generator/source-provenance metadata; every binary view
  is unchanged. Inter's extents and Bitmap/MSDF/Slug views are unchanged, while the package-owned subsetter serializes
  same-length `GPOS`/`GSUB` tables differently; a full Basic Latin plus ligature/kerning stress pass produced identical
  glyphs, clusters, positions, advances, lines, and measurements through both artifacts.

- **Removed product HarfBuzz subprocesses** — `glyph glyphs`, `glyph bake --unicodes`, and programmatic
  `@pmndrs/glyph/bake` now use the packaged Fontations/Skera baker Wasm. One normalized prepared source feeds core
  shaping and every requested raster technique; HarfBuzz remains internal test-oracle tooling only.

- **Package-owned font preparation** — Added generated `prepare` and `inspect` Wasm exports backed by Skera and Skrifa. The optional baker alone enables `std`; the same Rust source still passes its `wasm32 --no-default-features` compatibility build, and an ASCII subset is inspected and rebaked through the packaged direct-memory bridge. Measured `opt-level = "z"` plus Binaryen `-Oz` wins for this graph at 1,097,710 raw / 391,557 gzip bytes.

- **Single-package bake ownership** — Folded the portable font-baker Rust/Wasm source, TypeScript bridge, validator, schemas, tests, and build tooling into `@pmndrs/glyph`. `@pmndrs/glyph/bake` is now the sole programmatic product surface, while package-boundary tests prove the ordinary root import retains no eager edge to baker Wasm, `std`-enabled subsetting dependencies, Ajv, or glTF Validator.

- **Made multi-technique fonts one authored load and one CLI bake** — Direct `glyph bake` arguments now accept a
  known input/output, shaping-font Unicode subsetting, Bitmap strikes, MSDF, Slug, and byte-exact check mode. The R3F
  hello-world example deletes its custom baker script and invokes only that published CLI for both checked assets. Its
  runtime surface now declares the three raster requests once per GLB and receives a position-preserving typed tuple;
  the artifact is fetched and registered once while each technique retains its exact option and decoded-data type. The
  package now exposes one `glyph` executable with command-specific help and version output; `glyph glyphs` surfaces real
  font glyph names as JSON or a bake-ready Unicode set while omitting synthetic `gidN` labels.

- **Simplified publishing-size evidence** — The benchmark UI and Size Limit pull-request comment now share one strict
  nine-row projection: gzip for Core JS, Shaper Wasm, Three.js adapter JS, and Inter plus Font Awesome across Bitmap,
  MTSDF, and Slug. Confusing arithmetic runtime/delivery totals and alternate compression columns no longer enter the
  human report. The canonical record retains detailed independent measurements and budgets used by internal telemetry
  and regression checks; Three.js, React, and R3F remain external peers.

- **Provisioned the R3F asset subsetter on clean CI hosts** — The example's byte-exact asset check requires HarfBuzz
  14.2.0, but CI had provisioned only the separate 13.0.0 shaping oracle and CJK fixture tool. The authenticated utility
  provisioner now accepts either recorded release, verifies the 14.2.0 source archive as
  `94017020…eaff`, and keeps each build in its versioned ignored cache. CI publishes only the 14.2.0 utility directory to
  later steps. A fresh source build self-identifies as 14.2.0, and the complete R3F type/lint/format, byte-exact asset,
  production build, and live GPU interaction gate passes without changing either checked font artifact.

- **Fixed stacked-PR size reporting at the action boundary** — The pinned Size Limit action executes its configured
  command directly rather than through a shell, so the compatibility pipe had been passed to the measurement script as
  inert arguments and the action received the full report object. The workflow now supplies the same base-compatible
  adapter through an explicit `sh -c` boundary. Executing the exact parsed workflow command locally emits 39 validated
  `{name, size}` rows.

- **Closed detached WebGL2 PBO updates** — The complete Presentation matrix exposed a deterministic transparent Zoom Text
  frame on forced WebGL2 Bitmap. Three's PBO setup had replaced each storage attribute array with a padded retained copy,
  while later Rust command-buffer patches still changed only canonical storage. Dirty patches now copy their exact byte
  ranges into the detached upload view before texture invalidation; WebGPU retains direct aliasing. A focused integration
  fixture proves canonical/upload equality and untouched padding. All 48 Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug × WebGPU/WebGL2 workload
  cells remain visible with one renderer. The matrix also closed a benchmark-only transition seam where Off-axis's 120%
  default could be observed for one render under the preceding workload's 100% contract. The PBO fix adds 587 raw / 112
  gzip / 64 Brotli bytes to Three; core JavaScript and Wasm remain byte-identical.

- **Final renderer lifecycle size evidence** — Regenerated the canonical package-size record after the final Three retry,
  dirty-range, disposal, and transform-identity fixes. Renderer-neutral JavaScript and the optimized shaper Wasm remain
  byte-identical. The complete Three adapter adds 764 raw / 355 minified / 118 gzip / 82 Brotli bytes, putting the
  Three-plus-core total at 1,488,082 raw / 498,494 gzip / 395,212 Brotli bytes with Three, React, and R3F external.
  Every reviewed absolute and cumulative size ceiling still passes.

- **Reproducible TypeScript-to-Rust migration evidence** — Rebuilt exact base commit `90964be0` in an isolated worktree
  with its own lockfile and original public layout benchmark, then ran the unchanged 22,000-glyph target at eight warmups
  and 31 measured repetitions on the same Darwin arm64 host as the current optimized artifact. The base
  cold/font-size/width/suffix-edit medians are 58.32/12.09/9.15/39.61 ms. Current Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug complete
  `text_update` plus render-plan medians are respectively 15.90/6.04/2.78/13.48, 16.50/6.41/2.73/13.52, and
  16.73/6.64/2.96/14.37 ms. Checked JSON records retain the exact summaries, one shared Wasm identity, technique,
  allocation strategy, cadence, and glyph target; a fixture contract requires every comparable Rust median to remain
  below the recorded TypeScript median. This establishes the migration direction on this machine without turning timing
  observations into cross-host CI thresholds or declaring the p95-under-4-ms target complete.

- **Restored executable contract generation and compiled-ABI fuzzing** — Bidi/policy/UIKit and full CJK paragraph
  contracts now regenerate through the public Rust-plan `Text` query path and run in `--check` mode from ordinary
  benchmark gates. The checked fixtures stay byte-identical: a pre-f32-ABI numeric literal survives only when the current
  value is exactly f32-equivalent, and the known UIKit rounding seam is recomputed independently. A new fixed-seed Wasm
  smoke corpus mutates 64 policy and frame requests twice, requires identical bounded statuses with both valid and invalid
  paths, and proves a fresh valid transaction succeeds after every mutation. This replaces the deleted legacy-export
  fuzzing at the actual `text_update` and policy-registration boundaries; the package now passes 165 integration and
  three fuzz-smoke tests in addition to 158 Rust tests.

- **Closed the final adversarial Three lifecycle findings** — Consecutive render plans now accumulate and coalesce
  attribute upload ranges until Three consumes them, preserving presentation restoration and retry writes across
  multiple updates before one render. Disposed descendants leave the active batch without requiring synchronous host
  detachment; complete batch validation stays inside the group error boundary; committed paragraph removals recycle
  transform identities instead of growing the indexed table forever; and an unexpected semantic-query plan remains
  recoverable through the owned-publication retry path. Focused regressions cover pending-range unions, attached disposal,
  survivor rendering, and twelve create/remove cycles at constant transform capacity. All 158 Rust and 165 Node
  integration tests pass. The direct benchmark's default changes from 5/11 to 8/31 warmup/measured samples so p95 is no
  longer the maximum observation by construction.

- **Passed the complete foundation gate and refreshed release evidence** — The exact pushed foundation commit passes
  158 Rust library tests, 165 Node integration tests, unchanged Unicode 17 vectors, 112 benchmark-app tests, all 16
  isolated Chromium targets,
  production builds, the R3F live GPU interaction, formatting, lint, types, packaging, and OKF validation. Sequential
  eight-warmup/31-sample 25,515-positioned-glyph runs put Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug cold medians at 16.02/16.60/16.83 ms,
  font-size at 6.01/6.42/6.67 ms, column width at 2.77/2.77/2.87 ms, and suffix edits at 13.73/13.75/13.59 ms. Every
  comparable median beats the retained TypeScript checkpoint; the p95-under-4-ms optimization target remains open.
  The live 11,510-glyph Paragraph Stress probe holds one draw and 121 RAF FPS while attributing 5.725/7.405 ms
  median/p95 to public text update-and-measure versus 0.405/0.905 ms for renderer submission.

## 2026-08-09

- **Deduplicated exact ordered/stable planner machinery with measured delivery savings** — A focused Mori 0.19.1 audit
  identified shared identity membership, error conversion and capacity classification, cold buffer allocation, and
  draw-span invariants. Rust now owns each once while keeping the distinct ordered-direct and stable-indirect address
  loops local and allocation-free. The optimized shaper moves from 1,160,505 / 442,612 / 348,594 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes
  to 1,159,317 / 442,284 / 347,850, saving 1,188 / 328 / 744 bytes. All 158 Rust tests pass; the 22k complete benchmark
  shows no material warm-path change, and a 51-sample cold check measures 15.452 ms median / 15.670 ms p95 at 1.0% RSD.

- **Proved mixed fallback techniques and the R3F example in a live browser** — A public compiled-Wasm integration loads
  Bitmap Inter with Slug Font Awesome fallback and proves Rust partitions one paragraph into exact Bitmap `vec2` and
  Slug `vec4` program draws without a user-facing technique selector. The bounded R3F Vite example now has a durable GPU
  Chromium probe in its ordinary package check: it waits for authenticated fonts, verifies 13 laid-out glyphs as 11
  visible records across two Rust-planned resource meshes, then clicks the real in-canvas Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug controls
  through pointer events. TypeScript, React Compiler-aware lint, and the live interaction pass.

- **Closed the Three command-buffer retry and ownership gaps** — Three now advances `consumedPlanRevision` only after
  successful plan application and automatically retries retained owned bytes before another engine update. Upload ranges
  clear once per plan then accumulate across origin restoration, presentation edits, and Rust patches. Exact retired
  buffer generations dispose dependent materials even after a replacement occupies the ID, indexed table growth retains
  direct materials, and loaded-font disposal removes owner-scoped decoded resources. Material realization rejects
  synchronous text reentrancy before another Wasm call can invalidate borrowed views; semantic-only queries assert that
  Rust emitted no render work. Public compiled-Wasm regressions cover every failure. The 25,515-glyph public Three lane
  measures 17.84/6.32/3.04/13.84 ms median for cold/font-size/width/text versus the adjacent recorded
  19.42/6.59/3.10/14.24 ms, establishing no regression without assigning a cross-process speedup.

- **Removed the redundant homogeneous-policy glyph scan and preserved promoted-range alignment** — The first-party
  renderer policy uses one allocation strategy across Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, and external programs, so Rust now selects
  that strategy once before delegating to the planner; mixed policies retain exact per-glyph discovery. Planner
  compilation remains the authority that validates program existence and input shape. Dirty-range whole-buffer
  promotion now rounds its record end so `end * stride` still satisfies the renderer's byte alignment. All 157 Rust
  library tests pass. A short 22k-target run shows no material regression and the optimized shaper is 1,160,505 raw /
  442,612 gzip / 348,594 Brotli bytes, +182 / +42 / +233 bytes from the preceding artifact.

- **Made application gates respect their shared build artifact dependency** — Root package checks already complete before
  application checks, but the benchmark app rebuilds those runtime packages as part of its standalone contract. Running
  application checks concurrently let that rebuild remove `packages/glyph/dist` while the R3F example authenticated its
  freshly baked assets, intermittently hiding `bitmap_baker.wasm`. Root application checks now run serially; each app's
  standalone check remains unchanged, and the ordering removes the filesystem race rather than adding a retry.

- **Ported the external raster proof off the deleted host packer** — The private glyph-example consumer now uses the
  same public boundary required of third parties: its portable technique owns only identity, decode, retained resource,
  and disposal, while its Three registration supplies the declarative policy program and material realization. Removed
  its stale selector, binding object, canonical storage allocator, TypeScript glyph writer, paint hook, and exported
  legacy types. The focused compiled-Wasm lifecycle verifies Rust-produced sizes and colors before checking retained
  draw and geometry identity; no test-only core API or compatibility contract was added. All six package tests and its
  TypeScript, lint, and formatting gates pass.

- **Shared the compiled draw emitter and removed a quadratic stable-plan scan** — A symbol-bearing `-Oz` build attributes
  33.3 KiB of optimized function bodies to ordered planning and 50.1 KiB to stable planning, while confirming that the
  planners retain different storage, order-buffer, and retirement work. Their identical final primitive/draw record
  construction now calls one non-generic out-of-line kernel once per draw span. The strict stable benchmark then exposed
  that every changed range rescanned every sorted slot write; exact range partitioning reduces 22k-target font-size from
  350.136 to 7.982 ms median and column resize from 49.636 to 3.767 ms. Stable splice is 9.372/9.583 ms median/p95 with
  452 B written. The combined final artifact is 1,160,323 raw / 442,570 gzip / 348,361 Brotli bytes, 220 / 485 / 423 bytes
  smaller than the pre-extraction Wasm. Compile-time `lite`, `cjk`, and `full` runtime profiles remain a later measured
  delivery experiment with one ABI; separate Wasm assets, not one bundle containing every variant, provide transfer wins.

- **Deleted the duplicate TypeScript raster packing and lifecycle path** — Raster techniques now stop at identity,
  artifact decoding, retained CPU resource ownership, and disposal; Rust policy programs remain the only production
  instance packers and dirty-range publishers. Removed `RasterRuntime`, candidate/commit staging, glyph selection,
  storage allocation, record writers, their obsolete public types, and tests that reconstructed the deleted packers.
  A Mori 0.19.1 production scan corroborated the parallel path and separated it from the live ordered-direct and
  stable-indirect planners, whose shared draw-emission shape has distinct allocation and retirement semantics. All 154
  Rust engine tests, all 161 package integration tests, Unicode 17 conformance, TypeScript, lint, formatting, and OKF
  validation pass. The cleanup leaves Wasm unchanged and reduces core JS + Wasm from 461,917 to 460,901 gzip bytes and
  complete Three + Wasm from 501,815 to 498,922 gzip bytes, with renderer peers external.

- **Made raster policy origins exact without widening retained glyph storage** — The first-party policy had treated
  positioned ink-box starts as baseline origins, then subtracted the baked raster plane a second time. The mapping was
  dormant while the legacy TypeScript renderer remained authoritative and became visible only after the single-path
  Rust cutover. The independent Bitmap CPU oracle exposed a 12 px vertical displacement and 33,492 differing channel
  bytes; no tolerance or fixture changed. Rust now exposes explicit origin policy fields and maps each renderable glyph
  to its existing semantic-glyph record with one `u32` index. The already-retained cluster-ID lane supplies plan semantic
  identity, so the hot render glyph record does not grow. The public WebGL2 Bitmap target passes 32/32 exact frames with
  zero differing bytes and pinned SHA-256 `a47930d3…15e893`; the complete paragraph matrix passes 32/32. The 22k direct
  benchmark returns to the pre-fix 107.56 MiB retained high-water mark. Optimized Wasm is 1,159,121 raw / 441,811 gzip /
  347,554 Brotli bytes, 818 / 451 / 415 bytes above the prior checkpoint.

- **Regenerated package-size and edit-latency truth from the final stable-addressing artifact** — The renderer-neutral
  core is 1,257,322 raw / 460,673 gzip / 364,097 Brotli bytes, including the 1,159,121 raw / 441,811 gzip /
  347,554 Brotli shaper Wasm. The complete Three adapter plus engine is 1,505,897 / 500,509 / 396,903 bytes; Three,
  React, and React Three Fiber remain external peers. A sequential eight-warmup/31-sample 22k Bitmap run measures the
  ordered-direct equal-length edit at 1.330/6.328 ms and middle splice at 8.369/8.473 ms median/p95. Stable-indirect
  middle splice measures 10.683/11.149 ms and writes only 452 B. The earlier 51.067 ms stable figure was the maximum of
  an 11-sample run (the benchmark's percentile index selects the maximum at that sample count), did not reproduce, and
  is not retained as ordinary latency evidence. A stricter stable equal-length run detected late Wasm growth before it
  could publish a report, so stable-indirect remains a correctness capability rather than the first-party default.

- **Completed stable-indirect Three record addressing without changing the default** — The Three executor now resolves
  one validated logical-to-physical record address for Bitmap, MSDF, Slug, custom programs, indexed transforms, and
  origin augmentation. A product integration regression proves a paragraph reorder patches only the Rust order buffer,
  retains physical glyph storage, and reuses the existing draw objects. The shared nested-storage oracle renders the
  red record behind a green decoy exactly on forced WebGL2 and hardware WebGPU (16/16 pixels, identical SHA-256), while
  the complete ordered Bitmap/MSDF/Slug/custom-material matrix remains green on both backends. Stable slot lookup reuses
  the committed identity index for revision-only/reorder updates, improving two short 22k localized-edit medians from
  2.903 to 2.446 and 2.376 ms. Those runs are implementation checkpoints, not final tail evidence; the stricter current
  measurement and growth result are recorded above. Optimized Wasm grows 992 bytes from 1,157,311 to 1,158,303 raw bytes.

- **Added the missing middle-splice workload before choosing edit storage** — The unchanged replacement case remains the
  canonical comparison, while a new `localized-splice` case alternates one UTF-16 insertion and deletion in the middle
  of the same 22,000-glyph fixture. Ordered-direct measures 9.119 ms median / 10.016 ms p95 and writes 511.3 KiB because
  physical records after the insertion move. Stable-indirect proves the intended bandwidth result at 452 B but currently
  regresses to 10.776/51.067 ms; equal-length stable replacement is also 2.903/19.312 ms versus ordered-direct's roughly
  1.15/5.74 ms. No default changes: stable planning and Three indirection must become correct and fast before chunk-local
  UTF-16 storage can be credited with the smaller remaining edit cost.

- **Retained ordered-plan topology when physical storage membership stayed invariant** — The ordered-direct compiler now
  reuses committed glyph-to-batch and glyph-to-slot mappings under the exact policy fingerprint and capability set. It
  still validates every glyph and stable identity, and any physical storage-key mismatch returns to complete batch
  discovery; a material-partition regression proves both paths. Three consecutive optimized 101-update runs measure
  1.164/5.761, 1.153/5.740, and 1.155/5.738 ms median/p95 with five roughly 1.2 KiB patches. The preceding checkpoint
  measured 1.314/5.863 ms. Optimized Wasm grows 4,189 bytes to 1,157,311, and retained high-water memory falls from
  80.19 to 79.81 MiB. The fast class is now near 1 ms, while 81.4–81.6% RSD and the roughly 5.74 ms p95 keep the
  break-sensitive tail open.

- **Retained policy inputs and rebuilt only from the first storage mismatch** — Gathered field-major policy inputs now
  commit under the exact session revision, policy fingerprint, and capability set. A one-byte selection lane skips
  binding/resource/policy work for zero-change glyphs; changed records update only reachable fields. Identity replacement
  stays in the same physical topology, while technique, program, resource, transform, material, clip, or depth changes
  retain the verified prefix and fully gather the suffix. Commit/abort and disposal tests cover cache lifecycle, and an
  oracle proves identity/field updates plus a material-triggered suffix rebuild. The unchanged optimized 101-update lane
  improves from 2.607/6.184 to 1.314/5.863 ms median/p95 with five roughly 1.2 KiB patches. RSD remains 76.2%, so the
  break-sensitive tail is open. Optimized Wasm grows 5,856 bytes to 1,153,122; retained high-water memory is 80.19 MiB.

- **Continued recomposition until the edited line cursor actually converges** — The first retained-line proof required
  a whole recomposed line to equal its predecessor, which made convergence after a shifted line boundary impossible.
  Rust now recomposes consecutive old bands until cursor, height, and baseline return to the retained ending state, then
  reuses the suffix. A three-line regression transfers advance across one boundary and converges at the next. Exact
  equal-length ASCII-letter edits also retain structurally invariant Unicode and bidi results; punctuation, spacing,
  non-ASCII, and structural edits remain on the complete analysis path. On the unchanged 101-update optimized workload,
  median/p95 improve from 5.881/8.406 to 2.607/6.184 ms and RSD falls to 42.4%, with five roughly 1.2 KiB patches.
  Optimized Wasm grows 66 raw bytes to 1,147,266. The break-sensitive p95 remains above the 4 ms contract.

- **Rebuilt clusters only for the incrementally shaped source run** — Exact grapheme/glyph topology now permits the
  cluster builder to retain all other SoA lanes and rebuild the changed run's advances, bindings, glyph adjacency,
  safe/break flags, and identities. The affected window includes its predecessor break because that decision depends on
  the changed run's first safe-concatenation flag; any mismatch falls back cold. A field-for-field cold oracle covers
  every retained lane. On 101 optimized updates, median/p95 improve from 6.894/9.314 to 5.881/8.406 ms with the same
  five roughly 1.2 KiB patches. Optimized Wasm grows 7,633 raw bytes to 1,147,200; the p95 contract remains unmet.

- **Narrowed content-revision work to the recomposed line** — The line-convergence proof now carries exact old/new
  glyph spans into positioning. Retained prefix and suffix records preserve their revisions and publish zero semantic
  change masks; only the changed span compares fields or looks up stable identities. A focused test proves revisions
  `[10,20,30]` become `[10,40,30]` for a middle-span change. The 101-update optimized benchmark improves from 7.633
  to 6.894 ms median (9.7%); p95 is effectively flat at 9.358→9.314 ms, so no tail improvement is claimed. Optimized
  Wasm grows 1,693 raw bytes to 1,139,567.

- **Kept transactional text buffers synchronized across equal-length edits** — The retired UTF-16 and stable-identity
  buffers now copy only the proven changed range after commit or restore on abort, so the next replacement does not
  begin by cloning the paragraph. A 101-update rerun measured 7.633 ms median / 9.358 ms p95 against the preceding
  7.668 / 9.620 ms, while optimized Wasm shrank 520 raw bytes to 1,137,874. This removes redundant work but is not a
  latency claim; inserts and deletes still await the bounded semantic chunk gaps.

- **Stopped layout and positioning after a proven line-state convergence** — A same-length localized edit now
  recomposes only its affected line when geometry, metrics, safety limits, and overflow behavior are compatible, then
  retains the exact prefix/suffix lines and positioned glyphs only after cluster cursor, metrics, fragment slots, text
  boundaries, stable identities, and hard-break state match. Nonconvergence discards the partial result and exercises
  the full path. A 101-update production optimized SIMD Wasm run on the unchanged 22,000-glyph Bitmap case improved
  from the preceding 9.372 ms checkpoint to 7.668 ms median (18.2%), with 9.620 ms p95 and five roughly 1.2 KiB
  patches. Optimized Wasm grows 6,937 raw bytes to 1,138,394. The 80.38 MiB high-water mark and remaining broad
  cluster/revision/plan scans keep this outside the target; the planned semantic 64-cluster edit slack is still not
  implemented by the current flat A/B arenas.

- **Made warm HarfRust plan lookup allocation-free without claiming a latency win** — Cached shaping plans now compare
  borrowed language and feature fields; owned cache keys are created only on a genuine miss. The optimized SIMD Wasm
  shrank from 1,131,513 to 1,131,457 raw bytes. The 22,000-glyph localized-edit median remained effectively unchanged
  at 9.375 ms versus 9.372 ms, and the strict lane still observed the same later 1,114,112-byte memory claim, so neither
  issue is attributed to this lookup.

- **Bounded localized reshaping to one stable shaping run** — A retained UTF-16 edit whose style, script, bidi level,
  direction, and fallback topology remain stable now copies unchanged shaped runs and reshapes only the affected run;
  hard breaks, style boundaries, script changes, and bidi changes are therefore explicit correctness boundaries rather
  than heuristic byte windows. On the production optimized SIMD Wasm and the unchanged 22,000-glyph Bitmap fixture,
  complete Rust `text_update` plus render-plan publication fell from 16.223 ms to 9.372 ms median over 31 measured edits.
  This checkpoint is not a budget claim: cluster construction, composition, positioning, and plan gathering still scan
  globally, p95 remains 9.723 ms, and the strict eight-warmup lane still detects later Wasm memory growth.

- **Added narrow paragraph editing without exposing engine complexity** — Three `Text` now provides `insertText`,
  `deleteText`, and `replaceText` over DOM-compatible UTF-16 offsets; direct `text` assignment derives the smallest
  scalar-aligned replacement. Multiple edits queue into the same next-frame Rust transaction, surrogate-pair splits fail
  synchronously, and rich-text spans shift with explicit boundary semantics. A wire-level integration regression inspects
  the serialized request rather than inferring narrowness from final pixels.

- **Regenerated package-size truth after isolating baker build variants** — The renderer-neutral browser core plus the
  sole published SIMD shaper measures 1,224,539 raw / 447,121 gzip / 353,986 Brotli bytes; the Three adapter plus that
  core measures 1,466,450 / 485,864 / 385,930 bytes. Optional Three, React, and React Three Fiber peers remain excluded.
  Browser-core JavaScript stays effectively flat against the preceding record and the Three adapter shrinks, while the
  shaper accounts for the net compressed growth. The complete MTSDF baker is again 552,025 raw / 215,030 gzip / 168,758
  Brotli bytes after separating its 60,993-byte kernel-only Cargo target, and build-time ABI guards now prevent a partial
  test module from being published as a baker.

- **Prevented test-only Wasm variants from entering published baker artifacts** — Distributable MTSDF and Slug
  artifact-baker builds and the optional SIMD compatibility switch now use feature-specific Cargo target directories;
  the MTSDF kernel test uses a separate target. The package build rejects any optimized baker missing an export declared
  by its Rust-generated TypeScript ABI. The full MTSDF artifact remains 552,025 bytes with SHA-256 `ec6eb164…7de8` before
  and after the 60,993-byte kernel-only test. Generated ABI constants replace instance-ignoring or duplicate reader
  functions across the font, Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug baker hosts.

- **Removed timing instrumentation and stale-output risk from the published Three graph** — The package no longer exports
  or calls its temporary phase profiler. One-crossing integration evidence now wraps the Wasm export solely in the test
  harness, while benchmark workload markers and outside frame timing remain application-owned. Package builds recreate
  `dist` before TypeScript emission so deleted profiler and legacy modules cannot survive in a published tarball.

- **Closed the retained paragraph browser matrix under the f32 frame contract** — The sole UIKit mismatch was a stale
  JavaScript-double style-input expectation, not a Rust or Yoga precision defect. Independent f32 line-box arithmetic
  reproduces the retained engine's final baseline, content height, centered final row, and exact layout hash. The public
  browser target now passes two bidi, nine policy, twelve CJK, and one UIKit-shaped contract without runtime widening or
  comparison tolerances.

- **Separated final customer timing from temporary phase instrumentation** — The public Three workload can now retain a
  single outside timer while disabling its internal phase collector. A 25,515-glyph, 31-sample release-artifact run
  measures complete frame preparation, Rust update/render-plan publication, and Three application without internal clock
  calls. The packaged shaper is Cargo release + LTO + SIMD followed by Binaryen `-Oz`; adjacent `-O3`/`-O4` artifacts cost
  more bytes without a demonstrated speed gain. Production profiling hooks remain an explicit removal gate.

- **Specified paragraph-scoped synchronous preparation without triple buffering** — Current `measure()` either
  returns committed cache or drives a complete session update and plan. The reviewed follow-up design retains one
  speculative session transaction with paragraph-keyed pending states, linear identity reservation, explicit
  prepare/adopt/leave-committed modes, inactive-slot copied query results, host lease retention, and new-paragraph
  candidate ownership. Sequential paragraph queries extend the same transaction and the next frame adopts that exact
  work before global plan compilation. Roadmap items 11.17 and 11.18 queue the query layer and promised realtime
  publishing set as independent `feat/*` follow-up stacks after the Rust/Three cutover merges; neither is a hidden
  prerequisite for consuming the cutover. Factoring preparation from plan commit is cohesive but not a safe flag-only
  change.

- **Completed adaptive Rust planning for physical and stable-order buffers without accepting repeated packing** — The
  first per-buffer execution prototype regressed cold Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug by roughly 1.2/2.2/2.4 ms. Grouping identical
  selected ranges back into one active-buffer job closes that regression while preserving independent costing and
  committed gap bytes. Canonical before/after results are mixed and standard resize remains one unchanged-size patch, so
  sparse browser upload evidence is still required before claiming a win.

- **Started per-physical-buffer dirty-range costing without changing publication** — Added a stride-specific Rust
  coalescer with exact tests for divergent narrow/wide gap decisions, fragmentation and 75% full-live promotion, zero
  stride, and overflow. Existing ordered/stable callers remain on the compatibility wrapper until the next atomic
  checkpoint, so no upload or frame-time gain is claimed.

- **Moved ordered and stable physical writes onto per-buffer range plans** — Each compiler retains fixed reusable scratch
  for the policy buffer ceiling, applies semantic dependency liveness before range selection, aligns by the concrete
  stream stride, and packs the independently chosen spans. The order buffer and end-to-end timing remain open, so this
  checkpoint claims correct ownership and bounded allocation rather than a speedup.

- **Moved ellipsis and its real boundary reshape into the Rust frame transaction** — Only truncated flow threads build a
  retained boundary arena; ordinary reflow retains zero boundary reshapes. Font-stack ellipsis selection, complete
  no-wrap overflow, narrowed final-tail context, spacing, stable glyph identity, positioning, semantic inspection, and
  render-plan publication now share the one Rust update. A public Amiri/Three regression proves the result differs from
  incorrect whole-run reuse and matches the narrowed shaping oracle. All 136 Rust library tests and 204 package tests
  pass. Same-machine detached-baseline comparison finds column-resize medians within 0.15 ms and mixed cold results, so
  the checkpoint is recorded as performance-adjacent rather than assigned a speedup. Its aggregate optimized Wasm delta,
  including adjacent renderer-integration fixes, is +13,639 raw / +5,797 gzip / +5,579 Brotli bytes.

- **Recorded the Paragraph Stress integration defects without changing shaping invalidation** — Origin lookup indexing is
  now lazy and Bitmap strike replacement initializes every required input stream. The observed 11,510-glyph MTSDF probe
  moved `plan.apply` from about 1.02 ms to 0.14 ms and total retained update from about 6.89 ms to 4.63 ms, with differing
  sample histories explicitly preventing a universal speedup claim. Focused public Three fixtures cover both defects.

- **Queued adaptive dirty-range upload refinement from three-flatland evidence** — The research finds that Rust already
  generalizes Flatland's dirty buckets through exact spans, gap costs, fragmentation limits, and a full-live cutover.
  Follow-on work will calibrate per-physical-buffer costing and stable-order coalescing; TypeScript will not duplicate the
  planner. Renderer-local transform/origin edits remain the only candidate for a Flatland-style retained tracker.

- **Made semantic queries share the retained update that invalidated them** — Three now sends only changed text, style,
  or geometry sections; an empty update and cached query make no Rust call, while pending measurement or inspection rides
  on the same `text_update`. A two-paragraph compiled-Wasm regression proves all-paragraph semantic retention and exact
  command-buffer output. Controlled old-Rust Paragraph Stress runs isolate 14.295 ms baseline, 13.615 ms
  measurement-only, and 7.450 ms semantic-tier medians; the complete candidate measures 6.885 ms at 11,510 glyphs and
  one draw. Optional User Timing markers preserve phase evidence without claiming finer inlined Rust attribution.

- **Made compositing freedom an explicit Rust planning input** — `TextGroup` and R3F now expose the same `ordered` or
  `independent` construction policy. Ordered remains the prose-safe default; independent permits the Rust ordered-direct
  and stable-indirect planners to coalesce compatible interleaved resources. Icon Grid selects independent mode. The
  optimized shaper is 1,101,079 raw / 417,984 gzip / 328,164 Brotli bytes.

- **Made Presentation workflow failures and command-buffer work observable** — The workflow runner now rejects Vitexec
  browser/page errors even when its process exits zero. Stale stats cannot erase a retained-scene update failure, grouped
  draw/glyph telemetry reads the realized batch root, and the 27-cell sweep requires positive counts. Every
  Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug transition passes. The truthful result identifies Icon Grid's remaining policy gap: 2,926–3,021
  glyphs are split into 476 draws and run at 30.8–47.0 FPS despite only 0.27–0.76 ms median submit and 0.57–2.02 ms GPU
  time; this is open batching work, not an accepted performance result.

- **Made multi-workload Rust sessions recycle storage without recycling semantics** — Frame admission now covers removal
  plus insertion records rather than only final paragraph count. A recycled paragraph clears every semantic arena and
  identity marker while retaining its allocations, and one session prewarms one reusable paragraph instead of applying a
  4,096-glyph batch capacity to every child. This removes the invalid-request and allocation failures across the
  text-ladder, zoom, and 476-paragraph icon-grid transitions. Rust capacity identity, public Three double replacement,
  all 201 package tests, all 131 Rust tests, and a complete 27-cell Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug WebGPU transition sweep pass. The
  optimized shaper is 1,090,859 raw / 411,106 gzip / 325,149 Brotli bytes.

- **Made cold command-buffer growth recover instead of failing the benchmark scene** — Decoupled the 64 MiB output
  safety limit from the smaller retained A/B arenas. Rust's exact required-result watermark now drives one bounded cold
  reserve/retry; the host re-resolves the request pointer and recopies after possible Wasm-memory detachment. A
  compiled-Wasm test forces growth from a header-sized arena. The live MTSDF paragraph-stress scene consequently publishes
  11,510 glyphs in one draw instead of status 7 at 1,382,592 bytes. Three settled WebGPU A/B runs rejected an eighth,
  split origin/size storage binding: CPU submit was unchanged and median GPU time trended worse, so MTSDF stays packed.

- **Made the 25,515-glyph Rust benchmark self-validating** — The result header's `primitiveCount` counts primitive-table
  rows, so the benchmark's former “1 renderable instance” label did not prove the workload even though its 1–2.4 MiB
  writes showed full packing. It now sums glyph primitive `recordCount` values and rejects an undersized plan. On the
  unchanged `--glyphs 22000` fixture, Rust publishes 21,805 renderable records from 25,515 positioned TypeScript glyphs.
  Five-warmup/11-sample Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug resize medians are 3.779/4.345/5.082 ms with p95
  4.156/4.951/5.679 ms, versus TypeScript's 8.33 ms median. Rust wins, but all policies still fail the sub-4 ms p95 gate;
  isolated warm-session Wasm high-water marks of 64.75/77.75/78.56 MiB also remain open rather than accepted costs.

- **Deleted the redundant Three paragraph-target transaction** — The Rust command buffer is now the sole render-state
  transition authority. Removed the candidate/current `ThreeBitmapTarget`, `ThreeMtsdfTarget`, `ThreeSlugTarget`, retained
  revision, and old renderer-program registry; the executor keeps only GPU resource/draw/material tables, synchronization,
  and reversible presentation overrides. First-party technique imports no longer register targets as side effects. Migrated
  the composition proof to ordinary Bitmap policy packing plus `defineTextMaterial`, so customization changes canonical
  shader output without owning layout, attributes, geometry, or another transaction. This deletes 1,496 source lines. The
  measured technique runtime graphs shrink only 45 raw bytes each (19–20 gzip bytes for Bitmap/MTSDF and 20 for Slug),
  proving the deleted targets were already outside those consumer graphs rather than attributing an invented payload win.

- **Kept layout inspection and presentation outside rendering authority** — Added an explicit Rust semantic-glyph
  inspection mask alongside measurement; ordinary rendering still publishes no layout arrays. First-party policy
  programs now carry one stable glyph ID per renderable instance so Three can direct optional Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug origin
  presentation without reconstructing glyph topology. The executor restores authoritative origins before every later
  command-buffer update and retains only resource tables plus reversible overrides, eliminating any need to revive the
  candidate/current target state machine. Compiled-Wasm fixtures cover semantic spaces, shared two-paragraph batching,
  isolated overrides, transform-only retention, and semantic-update retirement. The refreshed canonical checkpoint is
  1,089,889 raw / 414,204 gzip / 325,805 Brotli shaper bytes; legacy-path deletion and a Rust size pass remain open.

- **Separated semantic measurement from the render plan** — Activated the existing `semanticViewMask` for an explicit
  retained-Rust measurement query while ordinary rendering continues to request zero semantic records. The first view
  publishes one paragraph summary plus its line records in the immutable A/B sidecar; Three's command-buffer executor
  ignores it. Public `Text.layout()` caches the frozen result until a committed semantic update. Rust exact and
  at-most/overflow tests plus a compiled-Wasm Three lifecycle prove the query retains the existing mesh and does not
  restore renderer-side positioned arrays.

- **Proved external Rust plan programs on both Three backends** — Replaced the glyph-example package's renderer-side
  `ParagraphBatchTarget`, revision transfer, packing, dirty upload, and mesh transaction with a static policy program,
  cold font-binding compiler, and plan-buffer material factory. A compiled-Wasm lifecycle proves Rust-packed buffers
  and retained draw/geometry identity. The live product proof now passes twice on hardware WebGPU and forced WebGL2
  with the same `817495c4…ba9d46` frame. Its cover baseline exposed individual visibility as a batching concern; indexed
  draws now suppress only the hidden text's matrix slot without a Wasm call or draw split, while direct draws mirror
  object visibility.

- **Completed material naming through Three and R3F** — Removed the obsolete `ThreeRenderVariant` generic and every
  `renderVariant` property, setter, span field, comparison, and no-op binding hook from the command-buffer-backed public
  adapters. `material` is now the sole authored name through numeric Rust `materialId` and renderer factory realization;
  legacy core/TypeGPU variants remain scoped to the path awaiting deletion.

- **Removed authored technique from Three grouping and font stacks** — `createFontStack` now accepts heterogeneous
  Bitmap/MSDF/Slug fonts from one runtime and preserves their technique union, while the legacy single-technique
  `ParagraphBatch` rejects that union at its own boundary. `TextGroup` and its R3F wrapper no longer accept or expose a
  technique. A compiled-Wasm public lifecycle fixture proves one Bitmap-root paragraph with an MSDF span is partitioned
  by the Rust policy/plan into two draws and resolves one custom material factory under both technique contexts.

- **Cut imperative Three rendering over to the Rust command buffer** — Replaced the public binding's private
  `ParagraphBatch` plus attachment `prepare`/`commit` state machine with one retained Rust session and renderer
  executor. A `TextGroup` now submits every descendant paragraph in one update and owns shared draws; standalone text
  uses the same path with its own root. Public `material` definitions resolve through Rust `materialId`, while scene
  transforms and render-order bases remain renderer-local. Focused compiled-Wasm tests prove mixed-font spans, one
  indexed draw across two public text transforms, retained custom material realization, reparenting, and disposal.
  Rendering deliberately does not publish layout arrays, and the old Three layout/snapshot/origin surface is removed;
  a future interaction or measurement query remains separate.

- **Executed both policy-selected transform modes in Three** — Generalized the command-buffer target across indexed
  and direct transform realizations for Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug. The same compiled-Wasm fixture now registers a direct
  first-party policy: Rust emits draw transforms `[1,2]`, omits transform buffers, and Three updates retained draw
  matrices from their scene objects. The existing indexed policy still emits draw transforms `[0,0]`, buffer 15, and
  the shared matrix sidecar. A hybrid policy additionally publishes indexed Bitmap and direct MSDF draws together;
  scene-only synchronization updates both realizations without Wasm. The engine policy chooses each program contract;
  Three does not rebatch the plan.

- **Bounded Three residency and retained draw identity** — Applied exact Rust buffer/resource retirements to dependent
  material and texture realizations, retaining shared renderer resources until their final plan reference leaves. The
  compiled-Wasm fixture now checks exact live storage-plus-resource bytes after Bitmap → MSDF → Slug transitions.
  Lifecycle-only reorder retains the same meshes/geometries/materials and changes range/order metadata; coalescing
  retains one compatible draw and retires only the other. Live backend submission still owns native-fence proof.

- **Carried Three material factories through Rust material IDs** — Added the public factory definition and a runtime-
  scoped identity registry while keeping Rust callback-free. The executor resolves each nonzero `materialId` only when
  a compatible realization is absent and supplies the canonical technique shader, final indexed-transform position,
  and a DRY default-material constructor. A compiled-Wasm fixture proves two material draws over shared storage, zero
  new factory calls on reorder/coalescing, and one new selected-factory call when the retained glyphs switch to MSDF and
  Slug. The public `Text` property route and fence-bounded retirement remain cutover work.

## 2026-08-08

- **Executed Slug from the Rust command buffer** — Bound Rust's five float `vec4`, two integer `uvec4`, and indexed-
  transform streams directly to the canonical Slug graph. The renderer retains validated curve/header/reference
  textures and keeps the WebGL-compatible packed-reference representation. A new full-MVP dilation input applies the
  exact per-instance transform to both placement and analytic half-pixel expansion while retaining the legacy row
  interface. The compiled-Wasm fixture republishes the same six retained glyphs as one program-3 draw after Bitmap and
  MSDF, without resending text or geometry. Wasm bytes are unchanged. Live shader compilation/pixels, bounded
  retirement, material factories, and public cutover remain open.

- **Executed MSDF from the Rust command buffer** — Extended the shared Three plan executor rather than adding another
  target path. Rust policy buffers 1–7 bind directly as MSDF `vec4` storage, buffer 15 indexes the shared transform
  sidecar, the renderer resolves and builds the validated layered atlas once, and the canonical `msdfShader` remains the
  coverage authority. A compiled-Wasm fixture changes two retained paragraphs from Bitmap-first to MSDF-first fallback
  without text or geometry resend and receives one six-instance program-2 draw. Wasm bytes are unchanged. Live pixels,
  Slug, bounded retirement, material factories, and public cutover remain open.

- **Made transform batching policy-selectable and executed indexed Bitmap draws** — Corrected the temporary global
  transform draw boundary. Programs may now split on transform and consume nonzero draw-level IDs, or omit that key and
  pack stable region transform slots into first-party policy buffer 15. The Bitmap Three executor applies Rust buffer
  patches, binds direct resources, keeps matrices in a renderer-owned sidecar, and updates scene transforms without a
  Wasm call. Visible overflow no longer invents a clip boundary. Rust tests prove split and indexed modes; compiled Wasm
  retains two material draws and collapses the same two paragraphs to one six-instance draw after their material IDs
  converge, with exact slots `[2,2,2,1,1,1]`. All 129 Rust tests and the focused Three integration pass. Optimized Wasm
  is 1,083,255 raw / 411,409 gzip / 324,539 Brotli bytes. Browser pixels, MSDF/Slug, and public Three cutover remain open.

- **Resolved Rust resource references directly in Three** — The Three coordinator now registers each validated Bitmap
  page, MTSDF atlas, and Slug analytic page under the same collision-checked numeric identity compiled into the Rust
  font binding. A command-buffer `referenceId` resolves in one map lookup; Three does not scan fonts or repeat resource
  partitioning. Incompatible technique reuse is rejected. Focused type-check, build, and compiled-Wasm coordinator tests
  pass; physical buffer, patch, and draw realization remain open.

- **Made transform ownership explicit and removed per-cluster draws** — The first real multi-paragraph publication
  exposed that paragraph-local positions had no renderer transform owner and cluster `semantic_id` prevented primitive
  coalescing. The policy now requires a paragraph-derived transform draw key, forbids transform from physical storage
  identity, and publishes `transformId` in the expanded 64-byte draw record. Compatible clusters coalesce; a span that
  crosses semantic IDs publishes zero rather than lying about one cluster. The compiled-Wasm fixture falls from six
  draws to exactly two and reverses `(materialId, transformId)` from `[(7,1),(8,2)]` to `[(8,2),(7,1)]` without semantic
  resend. Optimized Wasm changes by only +222/+83/+52 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes to
  1,082,773 / 407,870 / 324,551.

- **Published multiple retained paragraphs as one Rust command buffer** — Engine sessions now own an ordered stable-ID
  paragraph set rather than one paragraph. Lifecycle upsert/reorder/remove, every child semantic transaction, shared
  policy gather, plan serialization, and commit/abort form one atomic publication. Missing semantic spans retain a
  child, and per-child geometry retains only referenced regions/exclusions instead of inheriting invalidation from a
  sibling's global table prefix. A compiled-Wasm Three-coordinator fixture publishes material groups `[7, 8]`, then
  sends only reorder records and publishes `[8, 7]`; all 128 Rust unit tests pass. Optimized Wasm changes from
  1,073,248 / 404,463 / 321,189 to 1,082,551 / 407,787 / 324,499 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. This proves the retained,
  renderer-neutral command-buffer delta; public Three GPU realization and end-to-end latency remain open.

- **Preserved multi-paragraph Three batching in the Rust session design** — Existing `TextGroup` batches independent
  paragraphs, while the current Rust session's multiple constraints all flow the same prose. The cutover therefore uses
  one group/session containing stable-ID paragraph states and one shared planner/publication, rather than one Wasm call
  and buffer set per `Text`. The policy gather workspace now appends independent positioned SoA inputs after one total
  reservation, with an exact two-layout proof and no allocation inside append. Paragraph-keyed frame mutation and
  transactional session state remain the next Rust slice. Adjacent rebuilt-Wasm Bitmap runs measured 4.083 ms before
  and 4.078 ms after for full-column resize; that does not establish a speed change and does rule out a visible
  regression in this run. Wasm changes by +105/+40/+252 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Bound Three plan consumption directly to Wasm publication memory** — A reusable package-internal reader validates
  every Rust-emitted render-plan table and reads its fixed records in place. It retains one `DataView` across ordinary
  A/B publications and replaces it only after `memory.grow()`, so it does not materialize per-glyph JavaScript objects.
  A real compiled-Wasm Three fixture now shapes and lays out Inter in one update and observes nonempty resource, buffer,
  patch, primitive, and draw tables through that reader. GPU resource realization remains the next cutover slice.

- **Added a lazy Three-owned engine coordinator** — The renderer-neutral runtime does not statically import first-party
  raster programs. On first Three use, a runtime-scoped coordinator registers the all-technique policy, compiles loaded
  font bindings, allocates session handles, and reference-counts exact ordered font-stack handles. A real Inter fixture
  binds Bitmap and MTSDF to the same retained shaping font, proves identical stack acquisition shares one handle,
  reversed fallback order does not, last release retires the stack, and retired handles are not immediately reused. The
  coordinator remains outside the public Three graph until batch/session render-plan consumption lands.

- **Separated shaping-font identity from render-binding identity** — Rust font stacks now contain loaded-font binding
  handles, and each binding names its shared shaping-font handle. Shaping, metrics, and extents continue through the
  retained font once; policy gather follows the selected binding, so the same face may carry multiple raster techniques
  and fallback preserves its technique into the emitted plan. A compiled-Wasm Inter → Devanagari fallback emits the
  second technique, and another fixture registers two techniques against one shaping font. The unchanged
  25,515-positioned/21,805-renderable resize medians are 4.217/4.791/5.633 ms for Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug; 6–7% run RSD does
  not establish a regression from 4.120/4.646/5.622 ms. Wasm is 1,070,580 / 402,114 / 319,662 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Promoted complete frame-request serialization into production** — A package-internal compiler now lowers text
  mutations; full style records; constraints; sequential rectangle or polygon regions; polygon exclusions; inline
  objects; policy parameters; and revision/fence state into one compiler-mapped allocation. It performs no shaping,
  layout, batching, or packing. The current benchmark request is byte-identical to its established helper, including a
  surrogate pair, while a broad structural fixture covers language, OpenType features, material, word/letter spacing,
  baseline shift, decoration, vertical mode, holes, and inline objects. Public-state normalization and a real rich-frame
  Rust acceptance test remain part of the Three cutover.

- **Compiled the first production Three policy and raster bindings** — One deterministic policy now registers Bitmap,
  MTSDF, and Slug together against the retained Rust planner. Draw identity includes numeric `material_id`; storage
  identity excludes it, so a renderer may share physical buffers while splitting draws by material. Production binding
  compilers lower every validated first-party raster record directly into one field-major request allocation, including
  every bitmap strike, and exact tests compare every emitted lane with the established renderer-parity fixtures. Public
  string technique and resource identities use deterministic UTF-8 FNV-1a `u32` wire IDs with one runtime-scoped
  collision registry; collisions fail registration instead of silently aliasing. This checkpoint does not yet switch
  the public Three adapter from its legacy paragraph batches.

- **Promoted the retained frame ABI into a production host** — `RuntimeShaper` now exposes one package-internal,
  ownership-checked view of its existing Wasm instance to a typed text-engine host. The host owns cold policy,
  font-binding, font-stack, and session registration; reserves before pinning; writes requests into the retained arena;
  and returns the published A/B slot as borrowed bytes without copying. An integration test publishes slots A and B
  through the compiled module and proves B does not mutate A. Three still consumes the legacy paragraph batch in this
  checkpoint; request/policy compilation and render-plan lowering are the next cutover slices.

- **Made policy work dependency-directed from gather through execution** — Policy registration now compiles both
  input-to-buffer and operation-to-buffer reachability. A positioned update gathers only source lanes reaching a
  semantically changed output and the scalar/SIMD executors skip operations reaching no active output; checkpoints,
  new glyphs, and non-positioning changes remain conservative full evaluations. Consecutive glyphs reuse their resolved
  font binding and policy program. The mechanisms compound: selective gather alone regressed and operation liveness
  alone was neutral, while together moved canonical Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug resize medians from 4.878/5.355/6.001 ms to
  4.207/4.833/5.615 ms. Adding the lookup cache measured 3.981 then 4.120 ms for Bitmap, 4.646 ms for MTSDF, and
  5.622 ms for Slug. An isolated Bitmap resize measured 4.799 ms, so JIT-sensitive evidence does not yet close the
  sub-4 ms gate. Optimized Wasm is 1,069,973 / 405,888 / 319,558 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Removed visual-order scratch from proven LTR positioning** — A positioning pass now checks once that all retained
  bidi levels are even and no run is direction-overridden, then walks logical clusters directly. Odd levels and
  overrides retain the complete UAX #9 L1/L2 path. On the unchanged 25,515-positioned/21,805-renderable stress case,
  two adjacent eight-warmup/31-sample Bitmap baselines measured 5.197/5.162 ms and two optimized runs measured
  4.849/4.878 ms with the same single 170.4 KiB patch. Post-change MTSDF/Slug medians are 5.355/6.001 ms; the sub-4 ms
  gate remains open. Optimized Wasm is 1,065,857 / 403,525 / 318,137 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Avoided identity hashing for order-preserving reflow** — Positioned glyph reconciliation now checks the common
  equal-length/equal-stable-ID order first and compares exact content by slot; reordered output retains the exact
  identity-index fallback. A symbolized, non-shipping Wasm CPU profile identifies positioning as the largest sampled
  column-resize function and policy gather as the next largest. The benchmark can now isolate one case and accept an
  explicit profiling Wasm without changing the canonical default sequence. On the unchanged five-warmup/11-sample
  workload, Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug resize medians are 4.414/4.984/5.196 ms; variance prevents attributing a precise speedup,
  and the sub-4 ms gate remains open. The optimized module is 1,065,543 / 399,248 / 318,131 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Made physical render-plan patches dependency-directed** — Positioning now records exact six-F32/four-U32 change
  bits in a compact side lane while preserving the 60-byte `PlanGlyph`. Policy validation propagates those bits through
  the straight-line program once and records each output buffer's semantic dependencies. Ordered-direct and
  stable-indirect compilers execute and publish only intersecting buffers; new, rebound, and conservatively described
  records still rewrite every output. On 21,805 real raster instances, a full-column resize now writes 170.4 KiB for
  Bitmap and 340.7 KiB for MTSDF or Slug instead of 1,022.1/2,384.9/2,384.9 KiB cold-plan payloads. Font-size writes
  340.7/340.7/681.4 KiB respectively. Five-warmup/11-sample latency remains above the gate at
  4.599/4.916/6.057 ms for Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug resize; the reduction does not support a packing-dominance claim and makes
  layout the next measured optimization target. The optimized module is 1,065,394 / 399,111 / 317,830 raw/gzip/Brotli
  bytes.

- **Proved all three canonical render-policy shapes** — The retained Rust frame now consumes validated real Inter
  Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug records, derives linear color channels and inverse font size during policy gather without
  retained per-glyph arrays, omits the same absent raster records as the portable techniques, and emits the exact
  first-party buffer schemas: 48 bytes per Bitmap instance and 112 bytes per MTSDF or Slug instance. SIMD output now
  transposes SoA arithmetic lanes into tightly packed vec2/vec4 records before contiguous 128-bit stores. On the
  unchanged 25,515-positioned-glyph stress text (21,805 renderable instances), five warmups and 11 samples measure
  Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug font-size medians of 5.506/6.396/7.237 ms and full-column-resize medians of
  4.477/5.276/6.259 ms. These exceed the sub-4 ms gate and identify the next required invariant: policy validation must
  derive physical-buffer dependencies so resize and font-size updates do not execute or publish static UV, color,
  band, address, and count buffers. The optimized module is 1,060,971 / 400,835 / 317,139 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Measured exact retained Rust frame invalidation** — Style changes now invalidate bidi, shaping, metrics, and
  positioning independently; exact rectangle geometry skips flow when safe; unchanged ordered-direct frames publish an
  empty reuse transaction without scanning glyphs. A hard-break regression now skips the deliberately unshaped cluster
  before visual-run lookup. Over 25,515 glyphs, eight warmups, and 31 samples, Rust cold/no-op/font-size/full-column
  resize/suffix edit/localized edit measure 13.693/0.001/4.090/3.374/13.927/13.986 ms median and
  14.111/0.001/4.236/3.706/14.511/14.381 ms p95. The unchanged TypeScript cold/font-size/width/suffix-edit medians are
  55.25/11.90/8.36/38.55 ms. The comparison remains provisional because the Rust lane writes one F32 policy lane rather
  than Bitmap's complete five-buffer record. The optimized module is 1,060,175 / 400,500 / 316,984
  raw/gzip/Brotli bytes; the sequential 76.25 MiB process high-water mark is unresolved memory evidence, not a
  per-session budget. All 192 package tests, six fuzz tests, 115 Rust unit tests, and Unicode 17 conformance pass.

- **Primary HarfRust shaping now runs inside `text_update`** — A borrowed run view lets legacy batching and the retained
  engine share the prewarmed UnicodeBuffer, UTF-16 context, and reusable feature scratch. Retained style payloads feed
  HarfRust without an owned request, and glyph SoA appends directly into a pre-reserved A/B session arena. A real-Inter
  compiled-Wasm proof observes shape-plan count 0→1 after the frame and no increase after abort. Rust tests and
  host/SIMD Clippy pass. Optimized Wasm is 973,367 / 364,517 / 287,942 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes (+5,281 / +1,853 /
  +1,504). Ordered fallback, layout, nonempty plan output, and complete timing remain open.

- **Retained bidi and shaping-run itemization moved inside `text_update`** — UAX #9 output now fills reusable
  active/pending level, class, paragraph, and equal-level-run arrays. Root direction changes paragraph base level;
  nested direction carries a distinct override bit and forces parity during one style×script×level interval sweep.
  The sweep skips mandatory hard-break controls and commits/aborts with the session. Rust tests and host/SIMD Clippy
  pass. Optimized Wasm is 968,086 / 362,664 / 286,438 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes (+4,067 / +1,899 / -2,304). Fallback
  shaping, layout, nonempty plan output, and complete-path timing remain open.

- **Retained Unicode 17 analysis moved inside `text_update`** — The shared Unicode generator now emits compact Rust
  Script/Script_Extensions partitions beside the TypeScript tables. A no-std Unicode 17 grapheme iterator validates
  UTF-16, preserves UTF-16 boundaries, resolves contextual scripts, and reuses pre-reserved active/pending session
  arrays. Analysis commits and aborts with text/styles and is skipped for unchanged text. Rust tests, host/SIMD Clippy,
  and focused compiled-Wasm tests pass. Optimized Wasm is 964,019 / 360,765 / 288,742 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. Bidi/run
  intersection, fallback shaping, layout, nonempty plan output, and complete-path timing remain open.

- **Resolved the retained style cascade in Rust** — A derived A/B segment arena now sweeps validated containment order
  once, carries resolved parents in pre-reserved scope scratch, applies stated fields at scope entry, restores parents at
  exit, and coalesces equal neighbors without copying retained language/features. A nested/equal-range proof emits five
  exact segments and covers shaping, spacing, paint, material, and authored tie precedence. Absent root line height
  remains natural-metrics state. Host/SIMD Clippy and real compiled-Wasm lifecycle tests pass. The module is 895,593 /
  335,396 / 264,355 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes (+7,170 / +2,656 / +1,607). Unicode/run intersection and shaping remain open.

- **Admitted transactional retained styles in Rust** — `text_update` now decodes canonical style snapshots and
  removals without allocation, merge-compacts them by stable ID into pre-reserved flat A/B session arenas, and validates
  authored cascade order, nesting, UTF-16 ranges, language/features, registered stacks, root completeness, numeric
  domains, and request aliasing before commit. A real-font compiled-Wasm transaction commits text plus its root style,
  rejects root removal without revision advance, and preserves `memory.buffer` after session creation. The module is
  888,423 / 332,740 / 262,748 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes (+31,592 / +13,737 / +10,512). Payload admission is linear and
  retained validation uses one reusable-scratch O(n log n) sort. Layout does not consume styles yet,
  so no frame-latency claim is attached.

- **Fixed the retained style wire semantics before admission** — The compiler-mapped style record is now 88 bytes and
  separates stable `styleId` from authored `cascadeOrder`. A stated-property field mask preserves inheritance and
  explicit zero values, target raster density is available for Rust-owned bitmap strike selection, and generated
  vocabularies pin style, decoration-style, and decoration-line flags. Rust unit tests and the compiled-Wasm frame ABI
  test pass. Nonempty styles remain rejected until the transactional retained arena consumes this contract, so no
  shaping/layout or frame-latency claim is attached.

- **Admitted one-call editorial geometry into the Rust frame transaction** — Constraints, regions, exclusions, bounded
  rectangle/polygon vertices, and inline objects now decode as borrowed records from one pinned request. Validation
  covers limits, finite ordered bounds, enum/reserved data, identities, region ownership/ranges, pending-text anchors,
  and cross-section payload aliasing before mutation. Sessions stage a semantic fingerprint that excludes pointer-only
  vertex offsets. Compiled Wasm commits a complete rectangle/exclusion/object update and rejects a forged region link
  without advancing A/B publication. Optimized Wasm measures 856,832 / 318,999 / 252,620 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. The
  still-TypeScript 25,515-glyph baseline records 54.02/12.29/8.50/39.12 ms cold/font-size/width/text medians; geometry
  does not run there yet. Styles and actual layout consumption remain open, so plans are still empty.

- **Reusable HarfRust initialization workspace** — Module initialization now reserves HarfRust's real 32,768-codepoint
  info/position allocation and a reusable UTF-16 context array beside the existing plan/gather arena. Segment shaping
  returns that allocation through `GlyphBuffer::clear` on success and restores it on fallible setup without boxing.
  Optimized Wasm initialization grows 57 pages in total (25 new pages for shaping/context), repeated initialization
  preserves `memory.buffer`, focused compiled-Wasm shaping/frame tests pass 11/11, and the module measures 847,814 raw /
  315,809 gzip / 249,629 Brotli bytes. Legacy batch-result vectors and the not-yet-landed bidi/layout arrays remain
  explicit allocation gaps rather than being included in the claim.

- **Connected policy-directed gather to the Rust plan pipeline** — One reusable workspace now resolves every program's
  semantic/glyph/strike/resource recipe into 16-byte-aligned four-record F32/U32 lanes and feeds the plan compiler. A
  Rust proof emits a nonempty ordered plan with exact packed bytes across all source scopes and unchanged warm capacity.
  Compiled Wasm reserves its policy-independent 32,768-entry plan-glyph arena at initialization (1,245,184→3,342,336
  bytes) and one declared F32 lane at policy registration (→3,538,944); both repeated operations are growth-free. The
  production frame reaches the gather with empty layout input, so nonempty timing remains open. Optimized size changes
  838,060 / 312,606 / 246,732→845,580 / 315,285 / 249,221 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Registered normalized per-font render bindings in Rust** — Added a cold compiler-mapped ABI for one font-owned
  technique/program variant, field-major glyph/strike/resource lanes, scalable or ordered physical strikes, dense
  strike×glyph resource selection, and exact shaping-coverage validation. Rust hostile-wire and strike-selection tests
  pass; compiled Wasm registers a binding against real baked Inter, proves owned/idempotent state and conflict, retains
  it through the stack lifecycle, and removes it with final font disposal. The optimized module changes from 829,906 /
  309,646 / 244,790 to 838,060 / 312,606 / 246,732 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. Policy gather and frame timing remain open.

- **Made render-policy input shaping explicit data** — Policy programs now retain compiler-mapped source records for
  every typed input lane, selecting numeric semantic, glyph, resource, or strike data without callbacks. Source order
  is validated and fingerprinted; Rust and compiled-Wasm tests cover exact decoding, conflict, unknown/reserved data,
  count mismatch, and overlap. The optimized ABI grows from 828,401 / 309,252 / 244,402 to 829,906 / 309,646 / 244,790
  raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. Per-font binding tables and gather execution remain open, so there is no frame timing claim.

- **Registered ordered font-stack ownership in Rust** — Added cold, direct-memory font-stack lifecycle operations with
  nonempty/unique member validation, exact-order idempotence, conflict detection, and member-font retention. A
  compiled-Wasm test registers a real baked Inter font, proves disposal fails while its stack is live, releases the
  stack, and then disposes the font. Size measurement rejected a generic tree map at 837,865 raw / 312,057 gzip /
  246,478 Brotli bytes in favor of a compact cold vector at 828,401 / 309,252 / 244,402. Technique/resource binding and
  fallback shaping remain open, so this adds no frame latency claim.

- **Made Wasm engine initialization explicit and eager** — The compiler-derived ABI now publishes `initialize()`, and
  the standard host invokes it immediately after instantiation so module state is not lazily allocated by the first
  font, session, or update operation. The focused compiled-Wasm frame test exercises the export. Concrete 32,768-record
  shaping/layout lanes have not landed, so this checkpoint does not claim first-shape allocation or latency evidence.

- **Retained ordered UTF-16 edits transactionally inside Rust sessions** — The frame decoder now borrows and validates
  replacement records/payloads without allocating mutation objects. Sessions apply sequential edits to retained scratch
  and swap only on commit; abort or an invalid later replacement preserves committed text. Compiled Wasm proves cold
  reserve/re-pin, retained follow-up edit, invalid rollback, A/B preservation, and no same-capacity memory growth. Styles,
  shaping, layout, and nonempty plans remain open, so this adds no end-to-end timing claim. The reachable slice adds
  2,829 / 1,528 / 616 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes.

- **Prewarmed retained text capacity without multiplying shaping scratch per session** — Session creation now reserves
  both UTF-16 transaction buffers to 1,024 units by default, while cold create/reserve accepts an explicit text capacity.
  The production 32,768-record analysis/shaping/layout workspace is fixed as one engine-global synchronous allocation
  when those arrays land, covering the 25,515-glyph target without assigning that footprint to every paragraph.

- **Fixed the semantic update record grammar in the compiler-derived ABI** — Added exact UTF-16 text replacement,
  stable style, constraint, flow-vertex, region, exclusion, and inline-object layouts. Rectangle and bounded-polygon
  geometry resolve inside the same request; style records carry shaping, spacing, material/color, and decoration data.
  Generated ABI tests pin the record sizes and tags. Nonempty sections remain rejected until the Rust decoder lands, so
  this checkpoint makes no layout or performance claim.

- **Made Rust render-plan state session-owned and fence-safe** — The 124-byte compiler-derived update request now carries
  a monotonic renderer-fence acknowledgment distinct from consumed plan revision. Each session owns the Rust mixed-plan
  dispatcher and pins its committed policy identity. Wasm prepares, validates, stages, and only then commits planner and
  revision state; failure aborts the planner while preserving a valid already-completed fence acknowledgment. Host and
  compiled-Wasm tests cover accepted/future fences and A/B preservation; host tests cover stale fences, abort/retry,
  capability changes, and policy replacement. Post-prepare Wasm abort coverage waits on nonempty semantic input. Reachability
  raises optimized Wasm from 739,909 / 272,624 / 214,395 to 822,443 / 308,033 / 242,447 raw/gzip/Brotli bytes. Mutation
  sections still reject nonempty semantic input, so this publishes an empty Rust plan and makes no shaping/layout
  latency claim; the shared-runtime size increase is now a measured optimization target.

- **Compiled mixed allocation strategies without semantic partitions** — Added a retained dispatcher that keeps the
  homogeneous ordered-direct or stable-indirect path as one compiler and one direct plan view. A heterogeneous frame
  lets both compilers filter the same borrowed glyph/field slices, then merges only resource, buffer, patch, primitive,
  draw, retirement, and payload records. Disjoint low/high buffer-ID namespaces make the merged bindings unambiguous;
  shared resources are validated and retained across an allocation-strategy transition; draws recover original global
  order. Alternating-strategy, transition, mixed no-op, and settled-capacity tests pass. The dispatcher remains
  unreachable from `text_update`; optimized Wasm stays 739,909 raw / 214,395 Brotli bytes. The unchanged shipping path's
  25,515-glyph cold/font-size/width/text medians are 57.18/12.44/8.58/39.28 ms, so session integration and target timing
  remain open rather than inferred.

- **Completed ordered-direct display-list compilation** — Dirty retained updates now publish complete compact binding
  and command tables while keeping physical payloads revision-directed. Consecutive compatible glyphs compile into one
  primitive span and draw packet; interleaved `A, A, B, A` resources preserve three ordered spans over two deduplicated
  resources and buffers. Material IDs split ordered draws without splitting shared physical glyph storage. Draw records
  also carry numeric clip and depth identities, and the generated TypeScript ABI derives their 60-byte compiler layout
  from Rust. No-op output remains empty and one changed glyph remains one four-byte payload in the focused policy fixture.
  Policies independently select storage and draw keys, proving material-split draws both over shared storage and over
  material-partitioned buffers. The planner remains LTO-stripped until session wiring; reachable ABI/policy growth from
  the preceding checkpoint measures 266 raw / 70 gzip / 139 Brotli bytes. Stable-indirect compilation and end-to-end
  timing remain open.

- **Replaced the unimplemented effects vocabulary with material routing** — Superseded `renderVariant` and the declared-
  only `TextEffect` proposal with one batch → text → span `material` property and numeric Rust/Wire `material_id` identity.
  The Rust contract is fixed: policies control material draw compatibility, material changes never reshape or relayout,
  and different materials may share canonical glyph buffers. The exact Three material-factory API remains deliberately
  provisional for a later design pass; current first-party targets do not yet implement it.

- **Implemented retained ordered-direct physical patches** — Added an abortable native planner that groups glyphs by
  policy program/resource and uses stable instance IDs plus semantic revisions, never full-buffer byte comparison, to
  select writes. Capability alignment and upload costs coalesce ranges; consecutive changed records retain SIMD policy
  execution. Tests prove zero-output no-ops, one-record writes, ordered suffix movement, metadata-only tail deletion,
  checkpoint/growth, retirement generations, abort preservation, wire validity, and stable warm scratch capacities.
  Primitive/draw compilation, stable-indirect storage, Wasm session wiring, and latency evidence remain open. The
  unreachable native slice is LTO-stripped; optimized Wasm is 739,643 raw / 272,537 gzip / 214,149 Brotli bytes.

- **Completed the capability-shaped policy ABI** — Extended the compiler-mapped registration transaction with exact
  capability-set, program-planning, and physical-buffer metadata: backend limits and upload costs, capability-specific
  program selection, technique/resource and batch-key masks, ordered-direct versus stable-indirect allocation, and
  aligned padded strides. Unknown capabilities and unsupported combinations fail before revision change; the executor
  proves padding-safe writes. V0 keeps independently bindable vector streams and uses policy bytecode to pack `vec2`/
  `vec4` records instead of adding aliased mutable interleaving. The focused Rust and Node gates pass; the optimized SIMD
  artifact measures 739,647 raw / 272,532 gzip / 214,186 Brotli bytes. Retained diff compilation remains the next proof.

- **Fixed the compiler-mapped render-plan wire grammar** — Extended the aligned result header from 128 to 144 bytes to
  carry policy handle, capability set, and a deterministic validated-policy fingerprint. Added exact semantic, resource,
  buffer, patch, primitive, draw, retirement, and diagnostic records plus tagged actions and allocation strategies.
  Field-wise little-endian serialization rebases write-patch payloads inside the same immutable A/B publication and
  rejects malformed spans before touching its inactive arena. Rust unit tests cover every table and the header-to-table
  linkage; real Wasm integration reproduces policy identity, checkpoint/delta revisions, failure isolation, and A/B
  immutability. Retained semantic compilation is not yet claimed.

- **Admitted explicit-SIMD render-policy execution** — Added a production scalar interpreter for validated straight-line
  render policies and a four-record `simd128` executor with scalar tails. Registration resolves policy buffer IDs once;
  warm execution consumes borrowed semantic SoA fields, preflights every output, allocates nothing, and requires every
  direct-memory region to remain inside a live host allocation before borrowing retained engine state. Scalar,
  auto-vectorized, and explicit-SIMD artifacts produce identical horizontal, vertical, partial-tail, and four-byte-
  aligned outputs. At 25,515 glyphs, the representative 17-operation policy improves p95 from 1.174 to 0.428 milliseconds
  in Node and 1.113 to 0.438 milliseconds in Chromium. The production SIMD artifact is 530 raw bytes smaller and 62
  Brotli bytes larger than scalar. Boundary search, native SIMD, and whole-update contribution remain unmeasured.

- **Selected the first SIMD-shaped retained storage** — Added a test-only direct-pointer kernel lab over real 25,515-
  and 100,602-glyph paragraph arrays and three isolated Wasm builds. Node 24 and Chromium 149 reproduce exact scalar
  hashes for horizontal, vertical, partial-tail, and four-byte-aligned inputs with no warm allocation path or memory
  growth. Compiler-vectorized source beats hand-written record packing; explicit 16-lane break/bidi masks and
  integer-exact summaries pass the 20% admission threshold; large-workload evidence selects ABI-private 64-cluster,
  16-byte-aligned SoA chunks. The selected lab delta is 1,652 raw / 1,158 Brotli bytes, while the standard production
  SIMD artifact is 289 raw / 26 Brotli bytes smaller than scalar. SIMD now builds by default without runtime dispatch;
  `PMNDRS_GLYPH_SHAPER_SIMD=0` produces the same-ABI scalar artifact, whose disassembly contains no vector instructions
  and whose 34 focused semantic tests pass. Policy execution, boundary search, native SIMD, and end-to-end contribution
  stay measured follow-ups rather than inferred wins.

- **Proved worker-owned frame transfer and return** — Added a test-only, byte-opaque transfer state machine around raw
  Wasm publication bytes. One copy enters a bounded capacity-classed worker buffer; transfer to root detaches it and
  charges its actual capacity to explicit count/byte backpressure limits. Retirement transfers the same storage back,
  where a valid token/capacity pair either re-enters the bounded best-fit pool or becomes unreachable for worker-side
  collection. Four focused tests prove exact bytes, two-way detachment, reuse, missing-return backpressure, forged and
  duplicate return rejection, failed-send recovery, oversize rejection, and over-limit worker-side discard. The module
  does not decode the compiler-defined frame ABI and remains unwired from the shipping TypeScript layout path.

- **Proved the retained A/B frame transaction in the optimized Wasm** — Added session lifecycle, cold reservation, one
  retained 16-byte-aligned request arena, two retained 16-byte-aligned result arenas, explicit engine/plan/publication
  revisions, base-revision checkpoints, and a compiler-derived 120-byte request plus 128-byte result header. The result
  already reserves fixed semantic, resource, buffer, patch, primitive, draw, retirement, and diagnostic table fields;
  unimplemented nonempty sections fail at the Rust boundary instead of falling back to host typography. Updates return
  the selected result pointer in their single call. Success alternates slots, while malformed or stale-revision requests
  write only the inactive slot and leave the active publication byte-identical. A real Node/Wasm proof observes zero
  warm memory growth, then forces an 8 MiB cold reserve, observes the old fixed buffer detach, re-reads the aligned request
  pointer, and disposes the session exactly. Twenty-five Rust unit tests, both complete Unicode 17 bidi suites, and the
  optimized-Wasm policy/frame proofs pass. The frame shell grows the optimized shaper from 698,238 to 725,302 raw bytes,
  from 260,228 to 269,438 gzip bytes, and from 203,760 to 210,867 Brotli bytes. The tables are still empty, so this proves
  ownership and transaction semantics rather than shaping/layout performance. The still-unwired 25,515-glyph host path
  remains within run variance at 54.42/12.15/8.31/38.98 millisecond cold/font-size/layout-width/text medians and
  70.38/14.48/11.31/40.89 millisecond p95 values. The package's 186 integration tests, six fuzz targets, 117 benchmark
  application tests, 20/20 warmed headless conformance scenarios, and the 172,156-byte packed-consumer proof
  (`af7bfb85f04a6a63c6462735a6e8ec6d739576adb354c07ca51e744814db2f7b`) also pass. The aggregate benchmark script
  still stops at its deliberately stale checked package-size snapshot; this stage records the new measured size instead
  of rewriting unrelated historical evidence.

- **Registered fixed-layout render policies at the Rust/Wasm boundary** — Added compiler-derived `#[repr(C)]` policy
  headers and fixed-width program, buffer, and operation records to the existing generated shaper ABI. Registration
  performs one bounded direct-memory decode, rejects overlapping tables, forged lengths, nonzero reserved fields,
  noncanonical op encodings, and semantically incomplete programs, then retains typed Rust policy state independent of
  the caller's allocation. Identical handle registration is idempotent, conflicting registration is observable, and
  disposal is exact. No JSON, string dispatch, runtime reflection, or frame-path schema decode entered the Wasm module.
  Twenty-one Rust unit tests, both complete Unicode 17 bidi conformance suites, and a real optimized-Wasm lifecycle test
  pass. Making validation and lifecycle reachable grows the optimized shaper from 680,312 to 698,238 raw bytes, from
  253,568 to 260,228 gzip bytes, and from 199,365 to 203,760 Brotli bytes; this is registration-time infrastructure, not
  evidence of frame-path performance. As expected for unreachable hot-path code, the 25,515-glyph comparison remains
  within run variance: cold/font-size/layout-width/text medians move from 55.28/12.02/8.42/38.66 milliseconds to
  52.48/11.92/8.23/38.73 milliseconds, with corresponding p95 values of 69.57/14.87/11.07/41.06 milliseconds.

- **Began the Rust render-policy foundation without growing shipping Wasm** — Added the first renderer-neutral engine
  module to the existing shaper `rlib`, preserving the single `no_std + alloc` Rust/Wasm codebase rather than creating a
  second module. A bounded straight-line policy representation and total verifier now reject invalid identities,
  duplicate technique variants/programs/buffers/stores, invalid vector lanes, unknown buffers, out-of-range semantic
  fields, uninitialized or mistyped registers, and incomplete physical records before execution. Technique variants use
  the same data and functions; no technique-specific class or packer entered the core. Sixteen focused Rust tests and the
  two complete Unicode 17 bidi conformance suites pass. Because no Wasm export reaches the new module yet, the optimized
  shaper remains exactly 680,312 raw bytes; the compiler-derived direct-memory ABI remains unchanged until the policy
  records join it in the next commit.

- **Locked the Rust text-engine and retained render-plan architecture** — Expanded the narrower layout-boundary proposal
  into one `no_std + alloc` Rust semantic pipeline for Unicode analysis, bidi, fallback, shaping, per-line editorial
  composition, typography geometry, and policy-directed incremental render-plan compilation. The steady-state host
  transaction is one revisioned Wasm update with A/B synchronous publication, worker-owned transferable buffers for
  retained/asynchronous consumers, explicit return-to-worker retirement, invalidation-directed patches, and
  scalar-versus-SIMD admission on the target 25,515-glyph workload. The plan makes sequential regions and declarative
  exclusions one-call inputs, cuts unbounded publishing solvers and second authored text channels, and puts the
  Wasm/policy/display-list proof before added typography. Review of the base font-fallback implementation also exposed
  that its same-technique restriction came from the old one-program/one-schema API rather than shaping or measured
  performance. D-161 now makes technique and resource binding properties of each loaded font, permits heterogeneous
  same-runtime stacks, removes technique from user-facing `Text` and `TextGroup`, requires every first-party engine policy
  to support Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug, and lets third-party policies declare a runtime-validated subset. The render plan
  partitions resolved glyphs by technique/resource/program and publishes all participating resources atomically instead
  of requiring synthetic composite techniques.

- **Boundary reshaping was redundant by construction** — The largest single cost left in a warm update turned out to be work that could not change its own output. Each reshape range supplied `contextStart: run.start, contextEnd: run.end`, which is exactly the context the retained paragraph shape was produced with, so the shaper returned the glyphs it had already returned — on roughly every line, on every layout. The buffer's beginning- and end-of-text flags did not rescue it either: they describe the buffer edge, and the surrounding text shipped as context overrides them. Three independent lines of evidence agree. The mechanism above; a measurement over 640 ranges and 20,280 glyphs across Latin word wrap, Arabic word wrap, and Arabic character wrap narrow enough to force breaks inside joined words, where every reshaped glyph matched the retained shape; and the pinned natural, wide, and narrow layout hashes plus the entire alignment, clipping, max-lines, ellipsis, and justification contract, all unchanged with it removed. An early attempt to measure this by disabling the range emission alone was wrong and briefly looked like proof that reshaping mattered: clearing the ranges while leaving the fragments flagged made positioning look for a result that no longer existed. `ReshapeRange` stays, because a narrowed context is a real future need — a truncated line whose last letter should take its final form, or a line composed as an isolated unit for per-line widths — and the contract tests now assert zero crossings so reintroducing one is deliberate rather than silent. Against the pre-optimization commit on an identical workload at 25,515 glyphs, a reflow now lays out in 8.09ms against 110.40ms, inside the 8.33ms budget at 120Hz; a resize in 10.59ms against 103.54ms; a text edit in 33.62ms against 109.66ms.

- **Distance-field subpaths renamed, and the line that made it safe** — `./raster/mtsdf` and `./three/mtsdf` sat beside `./bakers/msdf`, so a consumer wrote one spelling to bake and another to render. The export paths and the symbols reachable through them now read msdf. The rule that made the change tractable is that identifiers move and string literals do not: a first attempt swept 370 occurrences across the monorepo and broke four separate things, every one of them a literal. The worst was msdfgen's own `mtsdf` CLI mode, which is a different algorithm from its `msdf` mode and would have silently changed what the native quality oracle generates without failing loudly. The others were the baked artifact kind, the packaged schema enum, and fixture filenames. Nothing persisted moved in the landed change: the glTF extension encoding value, the schema enum, the validator's diagnostic codes, the Rust crate and bin target names, the generated ABI module, the baker Wasm filenames, and every fixture filename keep their spelling. The benchmark application keeps `mtsdf` throughout, because its conformance scenario identifiers and `?technique=mtsdf` URL vocabulary appear in checked-in GPU performance evidence and moving them would mean regenerating hardware results for a spelling change; it consumes the renamed package symbols by aliasing them at its ten import sites instead.

- **Removed the layout profiler and moved debouncing to the controls** — The opt-in phase profiler came out once its evidence was recorded, returning 3,026 raw and 253 Brotli bytes, mostly from its call sites rather than the module; the browser-core ceilings were lowered to track what the tree now measures rather than leaving the slack it had been holding open. The comparison workload had been debouncing by discarding work inside its own update path, merging successive configurations into the pending one, so a dragged control reported the cost of the two updates that survived rather than the twenty it requested — a measurement of the queue rather than of the workload. Debouncing moved to the control a person drags, where dropping a superseded value is free, and the scene's queue became first-in-first-out. Placing that debounce in the viewport effect first was a mistake worth recording: the paragraph-stress motion drives layout width and font size through that same path, ramping the width roughly every 42ms across its first 1.76 seconds, so a 48ms window would have stalled the workload instead of settling an input.

- **Tiered paragraph layout by dependency** — Building the layout benchmark first changed the plan it was meant to inform. Every invalidation class measured within noise of a cold build: at 25,515 glyphs a resize cost 130.78 ms, a reflow 131.66 ms, a text edit 134.38 ms, and building the paragraph from nothing 134.66 ms, flat at ~5.1 µs per glyph regardless of what changed, which meant nothing was reused and the shape-reuse cache landed earlier was saving 4.8% because it was the only reusing tier behind five that rebuilt unconditionally. Three compounding causes, all structural. The batch collapsed five invalidation classes into one `needsShape` boolean, so setting a content box — a layout constraint the paragraph already answers per call — flagged the paragraph for reshaping. It also constructed a fresh paragraph per update, leaving the five constraint-keyed caches inside it dead on arrival and preventing the shape reuse from ever firing on that path. And font fallback probed for `.notdef` by laying the paragraph out, breaking lines and positioning every glyph for a result it discarded and making font selection depend on where the text happened to wrap. Retaining the paragraph in a layout session, asking shaping for the fallback answer it already had, and retaining Unicode analysis and bidi across any change that alters neither text nor base direction took a resize to 33.72 ms and a reflow to 27.98 ms, and separated the classes so a reflow now costs a third of a cold build instead of the same. Positioning was rewritten to write typed arrays in place instead of accumulating fourteen plain arrays and copying each through `TypedArray.from`, to select glyphs with two indices rather than materializing an array describing a contiguous range, and to resolve a text offset to a cluster through a table built once per preparation instead of the lower-bound search that ran twice at every cluster boundary of every glyph; that phase fell from 26.29 ms to 3.90 ms. Layout output is unchanged throughout, with 189 package tests passing.

- **Phase attribution replaces sampling for phase-level decisions** — A sampling profiler put `positionPrepared` at 27.7% of self time and Unicode analysis at 7%, and the first plan followed it. Both readings were artefacts of self time. Unicode analysis is 24.6% inclusive, fragmented across `extensionSet`, `itemizeScripts`, and `resolveGraphemeScript`; and a Chrome DevTools profile of the same chain inverted the attribution entirely, reporting `lowerBound` at 15.60% of busy where Node reported 1.9%, and `positionPrepared` at 0.51% where Node reported 27.7%, because V8 inlined the callees in one run and not the other. `measureClusters`, the function the original plan would have restructured first, measured 2.7%. Added opt-in phase spans through `setTextProfiler`, costing one comparison per phase while no profiler is installed, and `userTimingProfiler()` to forward the same spans to the User Timing timeline for a browser profile. `pnpm scripts run glyph:layout-benchmark` reports a median of warmed repetitions per invalidation class with its relative standard deviation and phase breakdown, never an average across classes, and applies a value no earlier repetition used so a retained constraint cache cannot answer a measured update. Recorded as D-159 and D-160. The mixed-direction Amiri golden earned its place during this work by catching a last-digit drift when positions were accumulated in single precision: alignment and justification read a position axis back after storing it, so every axis now accumulates in double precision and narrows once, following the axis rather than today's only caller, since vertical alignment is on the roadmap.

## 2026-08-07

- **Recorded Three material authority as follow-up work** — Applications can compose colour over the exported canonical shaders today, but only by registering a whole raster program, and the program-owned `MeshBasicNodeMaterial` writes no depth, so text cannot be lit, cast or receive shadows, or take part in depth-composited effects. Captured a proposal that render variants carry an optional material factory over those shaders, resting on the fact that core already splits ordered runs by variant and so already produces a separate draw per variant. Recorded as a draft research concept rather than an accepted design: maintainers have identified incorrect edges that remain unresolved, and the concept lists the open questions, including whether glyph coverage drives a shadow-casting depth prepass cleanly, what a per-variant material means for paint core has already resolved into canonical instance storage, and whether two variants differing only by material stay safely coalescable. Also noted that the separate request for text as a sampled function is satisfied today by rendering a group to a render target, which needs no package change and should be documented.

- **Exact target-v1 Bitmap rasterization** — Pointing the finite Bitmap conformance oracle at target-v1 exposed two defects in the exported `bitmapShader` that no coverage-threshold smoke check could see, because both moved ink without removing it. The graph still applied merged-v0's vertical atlas flip, which belongs to that renderer's `flipY`-enabled upload rather than to the target-v1 pages, so every fragment sampled the mirrored row of its page; and it had dropped the physical-pixel snap the strike's integer placement depends on, leaving quads to resample coverage authored at one atlas texel per device pixel. Corrected `atlasUv` to address the page's own top-down space and added `clipPosition`, the projected quad rounded to whole physical pixels, to the shader's output contract. Placing the snap in the exported shader rather than in `ThreeBitmapTarget` is what makes a composed third-party program inherit it by construction: the output offers no other route to a vertex stage, and the composed proof now lights the same 2,616-pixel set as the canonical pass instead of diverging in glyph footprint. MTSDF and Slug deliberately publish no clip position, since a distance field and an analytic outline integral are both correct at any subpixel placement. Migrated the finite Bitmap conformance lane — `bitmap-text-webgl2` and `source-outline-bitmap-webgl2` — onto target-v1 `Text` and `LoadedFont` raster data, which also drops the second raster load and decode the merged-v0 path performed. The migrated lane reproduces the benchmark's independent CPU atlas compositor in zero mismatched bytes and returns merged-v0's pinned full-frame hash `a47930d3…e893` with the same 5,930 lit and 3,473 half-coverage pixels and `[68, 18, 313, 112]` ink bounds, so the oracle changed renderer without changing what counts as correct. The retained proof pages move to 2,606 lit pixels for Bitmap; MTSDF and Slug stay at 1,935 and 1,510.

- **Exported canonical technique shaders** — Target-v1's Three targets each built their node graph inline, so a third party that registered its own program had to reimplement Bitmap's atlas sampling, MTSDF's median decode and screen-space range, or Slug's band walk to change anything about the final output. Extracted each graph into `bitmapShader`, `mtsdfShader`, and `slugShader`, exported from `/three` beside `registerThreeRasterProgram`, and made the first-party targets consume those same functions rather than a parallel copy: the export cannot drift from what renders because deleting it breaks `ThreeBitmapTarget`, `ThreeMtsdfTarget`, and `ThreeSlugTarget`. Each takes one instance's resolved nodes plus that batch's bound resources and returns a named readonly output including the intermediate coverage stages a composition needs. `registerThreeRasterProgram` now infers its technique so a program can type its prepared batches, storage, and binding concretely, replacing the three erasing casts the first-party registrations previously required. Rendering is unchanged: Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug still compile one draw with 1,226, 1,935, and 1,510 lit pixels on native WebGPU and forced WebGL2 with retained draw and storage identity. A new browser proof renders one paragraph through the pre-registered Bitmap program and then through a third-party program that owns its own attributes, geometry, and material and composes only its final colour over `bitmapShader`; both light the same 1,243-pixel set while the composed pass emits no green channel, so composition inherited the canonical placement and coverage instead of reproducing them.

- **Three raster program registry and R3F lifecycle corrections** — Target-v1's Three adapter resolved batch targets by comparing technique object identity against three hardcoded built-ins and threw for anything else, silently closing the public raster extension boundary proven in milestone 10.4 and making a wrapped technique unrenderable, so an application could not instrument a first-party runtime baker without losing its program. Programs now resolve through a registry keyed by the technique's stable identifier, with Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug pre-registered and `registerThreeRasterProgram` public; an unregistered technique fails at batch construction with a typed error naming the identifier. Rendering is unchanged: Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug each still compile one draw with 1,226, 1,935, and 1,510 lit pixels on native WebGPU and forced WebGL2, with retained draw and storage identity across a text mutation. Exported `selectBitmapStrikePpem` from `/raster/bitmap` so consumers reporting strike ppem, rendered ppem, and scale ratio as density conformance evidence read the same selection the technique renders instead of reimplementing it. Audited `/r3f` against the retained lifecycle and confirmed it already drives retained `Text`/`TextGroup` through desired-state mutation, leaving synchronization to `updateMatrixWorld`, proven by a real `@react-three/test-renderer` render under Strict Mode; fixed three defects it did carry — unwired `onError` on both components, a missing `invalidate()` in `TextGroup` that stranded group-only prop changes under `frameloop="demand"`, and a React peer range admitting 19.0/19.1 which lack the `useEffectEvent` the binding imports. Corrected a stale extraction-plan bullet requiring per-frame synchronous/asynchronous selection, which contradicted the settled Three API decision that the standard target is synchronous by construction. TypeGPU's three programs are parked unmerged: they validated the core API as intended, but author shader bodies as WGSL tagged-template strings rather than TypeGPU TypeScript, so they are excluded from the landing stack pending reauthoring.

- **Maintained TypeGPU engine boundary** — Added the internal `@pmndrs/glyph/typegpu` subpath over the renderer-neutral runtime and pinned optional `typegpu` 0.11 peer. The retained engine accepts a caller-owned root and pass, preserves exact program variant/draw/revision types, delegates synchronization through ordinary paragraph-batch attachments, and keeps transforms plus visibility in target-owned sidecar state without shaping. The implementation exposed one gap in the planned program surface: font resources and pipeline/run compilation provided no operation for allocating or partially updating per-batch instance buffers. Replaced that incomplete method list with an exact program-owned `createTarget()` factory; the returned public target owns TypeGPU buffers, resources, pipelines, dirty writes, draw compilation, encoding, and retirement without changing core. Focused compile and runtime tests prove variant rejection, handle retention, non-shaping transform updates, staged replacement, and target disposal. The reviewed target-v1 checkpoint grows browser core by 23,341 raw / 16,601 minified / 4,942 gzip / 3,976 Brotli bytes and the shaper graph by 1,475 / 1,061 / 163 / 153; merged-v0 Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug harness graphs each inherit the same 1,475 raw-byte shaper boundary while their compressed deltas remain 224/75, 220/180, and 223/177 gzip/Brotli bytes. Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug TypeGPU programs and live pixels remain open.
- **Portable built-in technique selection and packing** — Added renderer-neutral Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug technique implementations. Each retains authenticated CPU resources, explicitly omits absent raster records, returns stable font/resource bindings, and packs positive-down paragraph-local geometry plus technique fields into typed canonical arrays. Bitmap owns per-glyph strike/page selection, MTSDF owns atlas-array selection and effect fields, and Slug retains raw curve/header/reference bytes and analytic addresses without importing Three or applying its texture workaround. The canonical `/raster/bitmap`, `/raster/mtsdf`, and `/raster/slug` paths now select those techniques. The still-merged rendering harness moved to explicit Bitmap/Slug `/v0` paths while the new Three target is built; this is migration scaffolding, not a target-v1 public surface. Package tests cover absent selection, binding identity, range bounds, coordinates, paint, and Slug addresses. A fresh 42-cell Presentation run kept all seven workloads visible for every technique on WebGPU and forced WebGL2 with one renderer per case.
- **Technique selection and packing corrections** — The first built-in portable-technique implementation pass found two missing inputs. `writeStorage()` could not produce renderer-ready origins or resource-relative values because it omitted both paragraph-local displayed glyph origins and the binding core had already selected for the physical batch. `select()` also could not represent shaped whitespace and other intentionally absent raster records without allocating invalid instances. Added `originX` / `originY`, the exact selected binding, and an explicit `undefined` no-instance result. This preserves the original ownership boundary—core still lays out, applies origin overrides, resolves fallback, and partitions once; techniques only select and pack the supplied candidate.
- **Maintained integration subpaths** — Corrected the package-topology interpretation before implementation: Three.js, React Three Fiber, and TypeGPU remain maintained inside `@pmndrs/glyph` and ship through `/three`, `/r3f`, and `/typegpu` subpath exports. Renderer-neutral core still imports none of them. Only the gpucat fitness fixture is required to live as an external package consuming packed public exports without deep imports. Updated README examples, API specifications, architecture, roadmap, research, and D-144 around that boundary.
- **Renderer-neutral raster foundation** — Began the local-only target-v1 implementation stack with the exact-typed `RasterTechnique` contract, safe validated constructors for branded technique/resource identities, and type fixtures proving concrete associations survive while heterogeneous data remains `unknown` rather than `any`. The constructor addition records an implementation-discovered gap: the accepted branded input types could not be authored externally without unchecked casts. The erased storage contract became a partial property-key record because a total record rejects finite named-field interfaces; the concrete self-mapped constraint still rejects every non-view field. Split lossless KTX2 page validation and byte decoding from Three texture creation; Bitmap now uses an explicit Three adapter and MTSDF builds its texture array from the same portable bytes. The 42-cell Presentation matrix retained visible output for all seven workloads across Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, WebGPU, and WebGL2. Milestone 11.2 remains open pending first-party selection/packing and shader/program extraction.
- **Full external-review disposition** — Audited every blocker, high, medium, low, and unresolved item in the retained Claude Opus report. Separated runtime publication from renderer work: attachments now record the newest source revision, while an observed engine explicitly calls `prepare()` and `commit()`, preventing a Three scene traversal from staging another renderer's resources. Required the standard Three target to stage synchronously for its same-frame guarantee. Replaced universal underspecified Three shader contexts with exact per-technique associated types and anchored effect inference to the selected shader. Removed duplicate run order and batch chunk fields, defined capacity replacement as a new physical-key generation, documented run-derived transform indices, async variant-generation mapping, state flags, and missing public core types, and assigned unique decision IDs. The reviewed TypeGPU bridge is now recorded precisely as nullary WGSL injection with no proven Slug-resource or WebGL2 path; Wayfare reuse is withdrawn until source/execution proof. Re-ran gpucat's full suite (256/260 passing) and recorded the four upstream checkout failures without treating them as text evidence. Added a finding-by-finding disposition ledger to the TypeGPU research plan.
- **TypeGPU-first shader authority review** — Ran a read-only Claude Opus adversarial review, independently checked its boundary findings against the merged v0 shaders, pinned Three source, official TypeGPU documentation, and the reviewed gpucat source, and added a falsifiable TypeGPU-first research plan. The core batching/revision/attachment model remains renderer-neutral; the specs now expose pre-update raster density, stable batch-key identity, interface-safe exact storage typing, and synchronous target copying without an invented target font lease. Complete shader authority now includes vertex work and resource access, not only fragment coverage. The current `@typegpu/three` bridge is recorded as WebGPU-only and unproven for real Slug/Bitmap resources; native TSL remains the flagship path while TypeGPU is evaluated as a reusable WebGPU program package that does not require a full scene engine. Gpucat's GLSL-companion and render-order-interval limitations are explicit proof gates.
- **Merged v0, target v1, and external gpucat fitness** — Corrected the planning vocabulary: milestones through 10 produced the merged, unreleased v0 implementation, while milestone 11 implements the target v1 API and earns the first public release only after core and integration gates pass. Recast the pre-extraction API and raster-plugin guide as v0 migration fixtures instead of misnaming the merged implementation. Kept Three, R3F, and TypeGPU behind explicit maintained integration boundaries over renderer-neutral core exports. Reviewed gpucat at pinned commit `11cf91b`, mapped public typed buffers, texture resources, partial update ranges, multi-draw meshes, transforms, render ordering, and scene synchronization onto the target contract, and added an isolated external-package proof gate. Core API fitness passes by source inspection; reusable canonical Slug shader access and visible three-technique output remain executable gates rather than inferred claims.

## 2026-08-06

- **Variants, reusable raster shaders, and direct TypeGPU engine** — Replaced the over-constrained core “submission” contract with ordered `PreparedGlyphRun` values carrying resolved opaque batch/paragraph/span variants. Core still owns shaping, fallback, source order, physical resource partitioning, slots, canonical storage, and dirty/live ranges; engine programs now explicitly own variant compatibility and final draw splitting/coalescing. Split canonical Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug GPU evaluation into reusable backend `RasterShader` values so custom gradients/effects compose over the hard technique algorithm instead of rewriting it. Kept `TextEffect` as optional Three/TSL convenience over the default variant while admitting fully custom Three programs. Added the complete direct TypeGPU engine contract: caller-owned root/device/passes/RAF, explicit sync/async updates, retained paragraphs and transforms, exact-typed shader/program/variant associations, pass encoding, Wayfare program reuse, and optional `toTSL()` adaptation. Reconciled README, core, target, raster, Three, extraction, roadmap, decisions, and navigation around the new boundary.
- **TypeGPU-authored Three shader experiment** — Recorded `@typegpu/three` `toTSL()` as a real shader-authoring bridge rather than treating TypeGPU and TSL as necessarily independent implementations. The optional path can share TypeGPU-authored raster evaluation with raw WebGPU and Wayfare while the Three adapter continues to own nodes/accessors, materials, pipeline state, rendering, and lifecycle. It remains an experiment behind an explicit export subpath until the pinned Three.js proof inspects generated shaders, establishes Bitmap/Slug render parity, and measures tree-shaken transfer, graph-build, and shader-compilation cost.
- **Raster technique type preservation** — Replaced the proposed `RasterTechnique<any, ...>` erasure with an inferred concrete technique definition and a non-generic common identity constraint. Concrete techniques retain exact options, descriptor, decoded data, resource binding, and glyph-storage relationships; heterogeneous registries expose associated values as `unknown` and must narrow before technique-specific operations. No public helper silently degrades a failed inference to `any`.
- **Portable raster and engine resource split** — Split the next raster contract into a portable baker, portable runtime technique, optional shader-backend program, and engine target. Explicit font loading now ends with validated retained CPU raster data, including embedded or authenticated external page bytes; it creates no GPU object. Core asks the technique to select glyph resource bindings and populate canonical instance storage, then exposes the typed binding on each prepared glyph batch. Engine targets realize textures, buffers, materials/pipelines, transforms, passes, draws, fences, and retirement without rediscovering page membership. A TypeGPU program may be shared by compatible WebGPU hosts that expose device/pass interop, while TSL remains a Three.js-specific program over the same portable technique data. Updated the extraction plan and navigation around this boundary.
- **Renderer attachment verification** — Kept `ParagraphBatch.attach(target)` as the standard batch-scoped lifecycle coordinator while proving it needs no private shaping or allocation state. The public batch observer now replays the current revision, reports later publications, and completes on disposal, allowing custom publication policy to be built from the same contract. Defined dirty ranges as adjacent-revision deltas; late, skipped, or superseded target revisions initialize the live ranges already named by the current submission plan, while adjacent revisions retain the narrow upload path. Target staging failures remain observable without replacing the live target, and pending engine work must copy canonical ranges during the synchronous stage call rather than retaining mutable views across later publications. Added `attach()` to the complete core surface and removed an undefined revision-delta placeholder from the engine contract.
- **Identity-preserving capacity changes** — Removed core paragraph-batch cloning and Three `TextGroup` capacity cloning. `ParagraphBatch.setCapacity()`, `TextGroup.setCapacity()`, and standalone `Text.setCapacity()` now preserve every public and core handle while staging canonical and target storage replacement through the next synchronization. The setter records capacity intent; allocation occurs at synchronization. Fixed capacity means no automatic growth, not permanent immutability. The previous complete revision remains live through failure and target retirement; `TextGroup.clone()` and `copy()` are explicitly unsupported because recursive copying cannot safely preserve application refs, listener state, batch membership, or renderer ownership.
- **Three.js synchronization ownership** — Removed the speculative `Text.updateMode` and `TextGroup.updateMode` properties. One loader-cache domain owns one hidden core runtime; each standalone text or group reconciles membership, invokes the runtime-wide update, commits its staged target revision, delegates ordinary world-matrix traversal, and writes glyph transforms through its `updateMatrixWorld()` override before Three constructs the render list. Core dirty ranges become Three attribute update ranges there; WebGPURenderer performs the actual GPU writes while preparing the internal submission meshes. The core's allocation-free clean path makes repeated calls no-ops, and grouped text disables only its standalone preparation branch without changing caller-owned Three matrix flags.
- **Separate Three.js API contract** — Split the renderer-neutral core and Three.js consumer surfaces. The README now leads with minimal React Three Fiber and imperative Three.js paths that load one font, create one `TextGroup`, add `Text`, and attach the batch to the scene, then shows only real core calls and prepared-revision fields while marking renderer-owned buffer allocation, dirty-range upload, raster resource/shader binding, transform composition, ordered submission, and retirement as integration pseudocode. The authoritative Three specification keeps core handles private, lazily initializes cached shaping from the loader, late-binds unattached `Text` objects before first shaping, exposes only ordinary Three `add()` / `remove()` membership rather than a duplicate allocation shortcut, and assigns shared paragraph slots, buffers, and targets to the effective `TextGroup`. Detached text retains desired state without batch resources; reparenting recycles old membership and creates destination membership; direct scene attachment owns an implicit batch; and permanent text disposal remains distinct from scene removal, group disposal, and font disposal. The integration synchronizes from the Three render lifecycle while renderer-bound GPU targets stay isolated beneath one shared core runtime. `TextGroup` remains a non-Group `Object3D`, preserving the nearest real Three Group's primary order while supplying the secondary order for its physical submissions. Async supersession and cancellation resolve as handled outcomes; only preparation failures reject.
- **Canonical paragraph batching API** — Froze the next core API from the maintainer review and rewrote the README, full API specification, engine contract, extraction plan, decisions, and roadmap around it. `TextRuntime` coordinates explicit loading plus per-call sync/async synchronization; immutable same-technique `FontStack` values carry ordered missing-glyph behavior as one logical font choice; every paragraph owns its font selection; and technique-declared `ParagraphBatch` values preserve intentional render phases. Typed `txt` and variadic `span(...formats)` tags compile imperative literals and React nested text into the same UTF-16 source/span snapshot; reusable format tuples compose fonts, font stacks, layout style, and paint with deterministic left-to-right replacement. Core paragraph handles remain permanently batch-owned: batch disposal cascades, movement is snapshot plus destination creation, and retained paragraph/font leases make early font disposal fail instead of producing missing glyphs. Core owns shaping, fallback, sorting, raster-resource partitioning, stable slots, overflow chunks, canonical technique CPU instance arrays, adjacent dirty ranges, live-range recovery, and ordered submissions. Optional capacity now means only glyph-instance slots per physical resource buffer: explicit batches default to lazy 4,096-glyph chunks, while paragraph handles are unbounded metadata. The non-resizing policy is `fixed`, whose exact overflow is detected after shaping and fails transactionally before publication; Three retains and reports that failure without throwing from rendering or retrying an unchanged failed generation every frame. Identity-preserving capacity setters provide explicit larger-capacity recovery without transferring handles, buffers, targets, or public `Text` identities. Engine targets synchronize selected ranges into their own layouts and retain transforms, scene composition, GPU publication, and retirement. The specification rejects a retained public font group, runtime-wide preparation mode, update mutation callbacks, mixed-technique batches, and target-owned glyph regrouping. Implementation remains the next change.

## 2026-08-05

- **Renderer-neutral batch API hardening** — Replaced the provisional one-text-generation extraction sketch with one explicit many-item batch contract for paragraphs, labels, and font-backed icons. The draft API separates asynchronous loading from synchronous or Worker paragraph preparation, adds stable item handles, caller-requested growable/fixed capacity, deterministic item ordering, touched-item atomic updates, renderer-owned physical chunking, and owned glyph snapshots with reversible displayed-origin writes. The execution plan now compares the current Three.js API directly, sequences the portable technique split and headless batch before Three migration, requires Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug through a Wayfare/TypeGPU proof, and rejects TypeGPU shader canvas as the primary engine proof because its current public surface is fullscreen-fragment-only.
- **Renderer portability orientation** — Reframed Three.js/TSL and React Three Fiber as the first integrations over portable text foundations, added a compact public-core-to-adapter graph, and marked the serialized renderer-agnostic core plan as WIP.

## 2026-08-04

- **Renderer-agnostic engine boundary planning** — Drafted the proposed next additive milestone around three independent axes: canvas/game-engine host, GPU-authoring layer, and application binding. The plan keeps Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug contracts plus lazy bakers portable; extracts the Three-owned text-generation state machine without accepting its final name; preserves Three.js + TSL as the dual-backend baseline; and requires separate Three.js + TypeGPU and non-Three engine proofs before stabilizing package exports or an adapter API. The canonical roadmap order remains unchanged until maintainer acceptance.
- **Text layering contract** — Made framework-neutral `Text` a composite `Object3D` so it honors caller-owned parent Group ordering, while `Text.renderOrder` becomes the base for each generated drawable's raster-local order. Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, and the external raster proof implement the public base-order method and use neutral `Object3D` batch roots; the adapter rejects nested raster Groups, and focused tests cover cold publication, changes without reshaping, retained updates, React Object3D props, and multi-font spans. Against the parent stack layer, browser core grows by 707 raw / 504 minified / 152 gzip / 144 Brotli bytes; Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug runtime closures grow by 1,164/717/216/294, 1,288/781/232/311, and 1,237/774/254/186 bytes respectively. The reviewed absolute and cumulative JavaScript ceilings advance only where those production paths grew. Ordinary builds consume the checked-in canonical size record instead of rewriting it with host-specific measurements; the explicit size-generation workflow remains its sole writer, while tests measure the current host read-only against the reviewed ceilings.
- **Human-facing repository orientation** — Replaced the root README's stale planned-milestone narrative with a concise pre-release landing page for the implemented workspace. It now declares active development toward a public v1 API without implying npm availability, provides runnable local setup plus canonical React, Three.js, raster-selection, and bake examples, explains the shaping-to-rendering pipeline, and routes readers by learning, task, reference, and explanation needs. Corrected the font-baker Wasm URL example and moved its retired package commands to the source-indexed workflow surface.
- **Contributor workflow cleanup** — Limited the root command surface to `bake`, `dev`, `build`, `test`, `check`, and `scripts`; library manifests now expose only build, test, and check, while the benchmark app additionally exposes dev. Replaced duplicated command-family routers with one source-metadata index that validates and describes specialized fixture, release-evidence, fuzz, profiling, capture, and hardware-browser workflows. Removed closed-milestone probes, rejected experiment runners, and implementation-shaped benchmark tests superseded by public package integration, headless product, sequential Presentation, timed-demo, and exclusive finite-job recovery gates. Agent guidance now requires `pnpm scripts list/show` before inventing a maintenance command.

## 2026-08-03

- **Benchmark verification consolidation** — Folded the standalone Presentation-control smoke into the maintained all-workloads route probe, preserving Icon Grid slider, outside-dismissal, workload-label, missing-glyph, and Off-axis layout-width checks while deleting the duplicate entrypoint. Removed a brittle conformance source-string test in favor of the exact persistent-host, renderer-state transaction, target-resolution, and dual-backend product gates; shared one source-boundary scanner across the remaining static dependency rules and removed a duplicate registry workload list.
- **Milestone 10 v0 review closure** — Replaced stale “planned” renderer guidance with evidence-backed merged v0 Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug roles while labeling color, expanded-effect, and mixed-raster work as additive rather than implemented. Added a from-scratch external raster and baker plugin how-to covering identity, descriptor normalization, companion artifacts, Node and runtime bakers, static discovery, renderer-neutral `stageBatch` transactions, Three.js attachment, cold preparation, and lifecycle proof. The public API fixture distinguishes merged v0 surfaces from explicitly deferred proposals. The nine-workload consumer audit found no missing common API: bounded capacity stays raster-owned, matrix traversal remains the one warm publication path, and diagnostics stay out of production graphs. Complete deterministic and live browser gates, the corrected 59.84–60.17 FPS Advanced Shaping observation, exact package-size checks, zero-warning OKF validation, GitHub-verified signed history, reviewed PR descriptions, and green stacked CI close Milestone 10 without publishing a release.
- **Benchmark public-API and ownership audit** — Traced all nine live workloads through their public `Text`, font loader/registry, raster, and runtime-bake entry points and found no package-internal import or missing common API. Each example now owns a `workloads/<id>/{definition,scene}.ts` directory; consumers import the exact file they need, the root catalog only aggregates definitions, and shared/comparison-only contracts have explicit homes. Direct Wasm remains isolated to ABI conformance. Moved benchmark-specific Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug persistent scenes plus their metadata into explicit `techniques` subtrees; generic renderer infrastructure no longer depends on live technique or target code. The 1,300-line retained comparison host moved from `workloads` to `surfaces/benchmark/scenes`, leaving workload modules responsible only for authored construction, layout, animation, and retained configuration. The root `app.tsx` is now a 37-line route entry; one shared `HarnessRoute` identity delegates URL and transition state to `controllers`, renderer-aware composition to `surfaces/harness`, and application chrome to `components`. Boundary tests reject separate Main/Presentation component types and preserve one runtime-world and persistent-renderer generation. The API audit explicitly rejected public buffer-slack controls, a second `Text.flush()` publication path, and shipped update diagnostics because retained capacity, Three.js lifecycle publication, and benchmark-local telemetry already satisfy the observed consumers. Reclassified the retained raster comparison as a conformance surface scene and the isolated comparison preview as probe infrastructure rather than executable targets. The live lane exposed and fixed two real state/lifecycle faults: Advanced Shaping discarded an explicitly selected compatible font, and the retained comparison scene measured layouts before a font replacement generation became ready. The performance probe also mislabeled a pre-populated frame-history length as twelve steady reports; it now observes twelve distinct 250 ms telemetry publications per case. The isolated corrected run held every Advanced Shaping case at 59.84–60.17 FPS, with CJK at 60.02 FPS, 0.77 ms CPU p95, and 3.82 ms GPU p95. Vitest now builds the large-font replay inspector once in global setup, before parallel test-file contention, instead of allowing cold `cargo run` compilation to consume an individual test's deadline. All 321 unit tests pass. All nine workloads then completed sequentially across Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug; the timed demo observed its complete schedule with one renderer, returned to Off-axis / 3D, and measured Icon Grid at 60.25 FPS. React Doctor 0.7.2 reported no findings; its remote score endpoint was unavailable for the final route-only pass.
- **Final benchmark boundary locality** — Moved the deterministic TSL baseline and its tests from `renderer` into the conformance target tree, with the lazy registry and core-text browser probe resolving their true target and low-level readback owners. Moved the latest-value async queue beside the three React viewport controllers that exclusively consume it. Focused boundary/queue/TSL tests, strict type checking, the complete 317-test unit lane, and the real WebGPU/WebGL live browser probe passed.
- **Workload-owned retained comparison scene** — Moved the remaining 1,573-line multi-technique workload implementation and its 661-line focused test beside the authored workload definitions under `workloads/comparison`. Removed its standalone renderer, RAF, GPU-timer, and telemetry branch. Three Slug performance probes now use an 80-line measurement-owned adapter that creates one `PersistentRenderHost` and activates the same retained scene, completing all 40 fixed-32 browser runs across WebGPU/WebGL2, Inter/CJK, and both candidates. The complete 317-test gate passed; all 42 Presentation cells stayed visible with one renderer, and both timed demos returned to Off-axis / 3D at 59.90/60.02 Icon Grid FPS.
- **Canonical benchmark asset and raster metadata boundaries** — Removed renderer-owned font-loader, preload, baked-artifact, and raster-configuration compatibility facades. Live scenes and finite product/conformance targets now call the discriminated `workloads/font-assets` API directly, while Bitmap atlas, MTSDF extension, and Slug allocation inspection live under `benchmark/low-level/raster`. The complete 316-test gate and production build passed; all 19 isolated conformance/product scenarios remained deterministic, all 42 sequential Presentation cells rendered visible pixels with one renderer, and the retained comparison plus exclusive finite-job recovery probe passed on WebGPU and WebGL2. Live renderer chunks fell again to 9.26/3.38 kB minified/gzip for Bitmap, 7.77/2.85 for MTSDF, and 7.28/2.75 for Slug.
- **Persistent renderer API cleanup** — Removed the unused standalone Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug preview constructors and 676 lines of duplicate renderer, RAF, GPU-timer, telemetry, resize, and disposal lifecycle. The remaining contracts are named for persistent scenes, and a boundary regression rejects reintroducing preview entrypoints. The complete 315-test benchmark gate and production build passed; live renderer chunks fell from 16.82/5.19 to 10.37/3.84 kB minified/gzip for Bitmap, 9.02/3.32 to 8.37/3.12 for MTSDF, and 9.26/3.37 to 8.19/3.09 for Slug. All 42 sequential Presentation cells rendered visible pixels with one renderer, and both timed demos completed their authored sequence, returned to Off-axis / 3D, and measured 59.92/60.02 Icon Grid FPS on WebGPU/WebGL2.
- **Slug conformance scene locality** — Moved the Slug release-role scene definitions from the reusable renderer directory beside the conformance capture that owns and executes them. The capture script and URL-loaded browser probe now resolve the target-owned module directly, and the benchmark boundary regression rejects the obsolete renderer path.
- **Bitmap conformance target ownership** — Moved the remaining finite Bitmap and source-outline wrappers from the live renderer into `benchmark/targets/conformance/raster/bitmap-capture`, retaining the renderer-neutral finite scene and exact atlas reference under `benchmark/low-level/raster`. Conformance targets, runtime fallback, and the React finite surface now import only the target wrapper; boundary tests reject every old renderer capture path. The complete 314-test benchmark gate and production build passed, and all 19 isolated browser scenarios—including exact Bitmap product and source-outline captures—remained deterministic.
- **Target-owned raster conformance captures** — Moved finite MTSDF and Slug resource creation, standard/source-outline capture, CPU comparison, borrowed-renderer state restoration, and disposal from live renderer modules into `benchmark/targets/conformance/raster`. Both techniques now implement the same warm session contract directly; Slug's external-resource, large/extreme/complex/clipped, affine, and projection-zoom proofs moved with the shared finite resource graph. Conformance surfaces, runtime fallback, and URL-loaded probes import the target modules directly. The complete 314-test benchmark gate and production build passed, all 19 isolated browser scenarios remained deterministic, retained comparison capture/navigation recovery passed on WebGPU and forced WebGL2, and both complete Slug role and external-resource probes passed on both backends.
- **Finite product target ownership** — Moved the Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug finite public-`Text` product lifecycles from renderer implementation files into lazy `benchmark/targets/product` modules. Extracted Bitmap line construction, the reusable finite Bitmap scene, exact CPU-reference capture, and renderer-neutral RGBA8 readback into explicit renderer/low-level modules; conformance surfaces consume the neutral capture contract without importing an executable product target. The complete 314-test benchmark gate and production build passed, all 19 isolated headless scenarios remained deterministic, the external raster and retained comparison probes recovered on WebGPU and forced WebGL2, all 42 sequential Presentation cells rendered with one renderer, both timed demos returned to Off-axis / 3D at 60.02 FPS, and React Doctor reported 100/100 with no issues.
- **Explicit low-level target hierarchy** — Moved the external raster and React reconciliation product proofs under `benchmark/targets/product`; moved the realtime MTSDF/Slug comparison, runtime fallback, and their target tests under `benchmark/targets/conformance/raster`; and placed shared CPU raster/source-outline oracles under `benchmark/low-level/raster`. Conformance surfaces retain literal lazy target imports, while a boundary regression rejects renderer imports of executable targets. The complete 311-test benchmark gate and production build passed, all 19 isolated headless scenarios remained deterministic, and the moved realtime comparison and external raster proof recovered on both WebGPU and forced WebGL2.
- **Canonical benchmark font assets** — Moved source-font selection, baked fixture URLs, authenticated gzip transport, public `FontLoader` runtime fallback, raster requests, progress, and delivery metrics from renderer-owned files into `workloads/font-assets`. One discriminated adapter selects Bitmap, MTSDF, or Slug through literal dynamic imports; workload code cannot reach direct baker or Wasm URLs, while renderer modules retain live GPU lifecycle and compatibility delegates. Review restored post-registration abort checks and corrected runtime source-font selection. The complete 310-test benchmark gate, production chunk build, React Doctor, all 42 dual-backend Presentation workload cells, both timed demos at 60.02/60.47 Icon Grid FPS, all 19 headless conformance scenarios, and the dual-backend external raster proof passed.
- **Canonical single-paragraph scenes** — Added one workload-owned `LiveTextScene` contract and registry so Benchmark Ipsum and Advanced Shaping project their complete public `Text` inputs beside their authored content instead of relying on a route-local workload switch. Advanced Shaping now derives its fixture from the selected authored case, while Benchmark Ipsum keeps its exact 1,151-glyph assertion scoped to Inter. Renderer adapters add only runtime font size and retain technique-specific lifecycle ownership. Exact projection, registry, and renderer-boundary tests passed within the complete 307-test benchmark gate.
- **Persistent viewport hierarchy** — Moved the Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug live-text viewport controllers, their warm update queues, loading chrome, telemetry attributes, and shared contracts from the route coordinator into `surfaces/benchmark`. Review caught mixed type imports collapsing the lazy renderer boundaries; explicit `import type` declarations restored separate Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug production chunks. The complete deterministic benchmark check and React Doctor remained clean, all 42 retained-scene cells passed with visible pixels and one renderer, and both 60-second timed demos traversed Advanced Shaping and returned to Off-axis / 3D with one renderer at 60.02 WebGPU and 60.36 forced-WebGL2 Icon Grid FPS.
- **Workload instance and low-level target isolation** — Moved Icon Grid's active virtual window, recycle epochs, pan/autopan smoothing, refresh suspension, visibility, and metrics into one per-mount workload instance while leaving renderer, RAF, font transactions, scene attachment, and telemetry in the persistent host. Extracted Main/Presentation composition, runtime control binding, benchmark surface chrome, and bake progress into named React modules. Added a common target-owned MTSDF/Slug conformance session that forwards the borrowed renderer and abort signal while retaining renderer-private resources behind adapters. The first browser pass exposed Text Ladder's offscreen scene transform leaking into Zoom Text; explicit per-workload scene initialization corrected the black frame. The repeated 42-cell dual-backend Presentation matrix then completed with visible pixels and one renderer per lane, all 19 isolated headless conformance scenarios passed, React Doctor reported zero diagnostics, and the complete deterministic benchmark gate passed 301 tests.
- **Complete workload phase ownership** — Added typed animation and retained-configuration hooks to all seven retained workload definitions using preallocated host scratch, eliminating the renderer's remaining create/layout/animate/apply dispatch switches without moving RAF, telemetry, or renderer lifecycle into workload code. Moved the Benchmark Ipsum corpus and Advanced Shaping timeline beside the other authored workloads, and moved the self-contained Advanced Shaping conformance target under `benchmark/targets/conformance` behind the same literal selected-target dynamic import. Coupled raster targets remain in place pending a session adapter that preserves their warm load/run/dispose lifecycle. The post-move Chromium run completed all 42 dual-backend Presentation workload cells with visible pixels and one renderer per lane; all 19 isolated headless conformance scenarios passed, including three exact 68-frame Advanced Shaping timelines with zero warm readiness waits.
- **Workload controller boundary** — Made all seven retained workload definitions own typed app-private construction and layout hooks, so the renderer selects those behaviors only through the exhaustive registry. Moved Icon Grid layout, virtual-window calculation, assignment validation, recycled-entry positioning, pan integration, and frame-delta smoothing beside its canonical public `Text` example. Main and Presentation now derive descriptions, amount labels, fixed/selectable font behavior, preload grouping, and pan/zoom capability from the typed catalog instead of duplicating workload-ID policy. Renderer, canvas, RAF, GPU timer, telemetry, font transactions, active pool ownership, and teardown remain host infrastructure; no public package API was added. Chromium 149 completed all 42 Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug × WebGPU/WebGL2 × seven-workload Presentation cells with visible pixels, one renderer per lane, and no reported console failure.
- **Workload scene and conformance locality** — Moved Text Ladder, Zoom Text, Off-axis / 3D, Dynamic Layout, Paragraph Stress, and Paint & Effects layout and animation behavior beside their public `Text` constructors, leaving the retained renderer as a dispatcher and Icon Grid virtualization as the next controller extraction. Extracted the conformance React hierarchy from the root application while preserving one host-owned renderer for retained comparisons and exclusive finite captures. A deterministic delayed-peer regression proved the realtime MSDF / Slug comparison could refresh one candidate generation early; the private scene now retains the last complete target pair, defers target resize, publishes both retained objects in one task, rolls both back on failure, and drains an in-flight pair before disposal. Seven focused lifecycle cases cover renderer-state restoration, success, failure, abort, partial readiness, rollback, and delayed resize without admitting a renderer-wide grouped-publication API.
- **Benchmark workload policy and target ownership** — Added one typed catalog for all nine live benchmark workloads, including exact Main/Presentation reset defaults, font policy, controls, interaction, preload, and surface kind. Benchmark rail metadata and runtime resets project from that authority, and URL parsing normalizes unknown workload IDs inside the selected mode before downstream policy executes. Moved technique-invariant text styling and color motion below `workloads/shared` and added a static/dynamic source boundary that rejects workload dependencies on renderer implementation modules. Reclassified public loader/Worker parity as conformance, moved direct Wasm dependencies into one shared selected-ABI adapter, and retained boundary tests that reject raw Wasm imports elsewhere.
- **Benchmark-driven API discovery** — Audited every live workload against the published `Text`, loader, registry, raster, and React surfaces. The seven retained comparison examples need no new package API; benchmark telemetry, fixture authentication, and ABI measurement remain application concerns. Corrected the nullable baked-source override fixture and recorded delayed-peer publication in the MSDF / Slug comparison as an evidence candidate that must fail a distinguishing probe before any grouped public transaction is considered.

## 2026-08-01

- **Presentation retained-workload closure** — Removed benchmark-side warm `ready` coordination from retained layout, font, and Dynamic Layout updates; all publish through the Three.js lifecycle. Zoom now pre-shapes its complete 16-word multilingual corpus during cold scene construction and performs only resident scale/opacity/visibility animation. Icon Grid stages cold pool growth off-scene, publishes new view defaults atomically, drains recycling synchronously with retained scratch storage, and no longer allocates per-entry geometry sets or active-layout arrays on every frame. The six-cell Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug × WebGPU/WebGL workload matrix held visible pixels through all seven comparison scenes with one renderer and no warnings; both 60-second timed demos completed their authored sequence and ended on Off-axis / 3D at 60.02 Icon Grid FPS. The 27-cell WebGPU cadence sweep held 60.0–60.2 RAF FPS with zero slow frames in every MTSDF/Slug cell and every Bitmap cell except the deliberate 11,510-glyph/1,120-draw Paragraph Stress case, which measured 58.8 FPS with three frames above 20 ms. The corrected Icon Grid evidence workflow retains a bounded CPU profile and performance trace instead of attempting an unbounded heap-summary serialization; its 20-second run recycled 660 assignments with 18.60 ms p95, 18.64 ms maximum, and zero slow frames. Pinned React Doctor 0.7.2 reports zero diagnostics and a 100/100 score; the retained screenshot workflow covers all seven workloads on both backends. Every commit in the nine-PR stack is GitHub-verified for the configured maintainer identity, every PR body records its exact scope and evidence, and every latest CI run passes.
- **Public external raster proof** — Completed roadmap item 10.4 with the private `@pmndrs/glyph-example-raster` workspace package. It owns a new literal kind, descriptor, standalone companion GLB, embedded/authenticated-external records, static/runtime bakers, decoder, TSL adapter, retained slack and dirty uploads, overflow, abort, and disposal using only published core entry points and its own Three.js dependency. The proof exposed and fixed the hidden Three draw-object typing requirement and dropped `resolveResource` forwarding. Public Node bake/load tests and a real source-fallback browser lane pass; WebGPU and forced WebGL2 borrow one renderer, restore finite state, retain object/geometry identity, and produce the same deterministic visible-frame hash. The complete browser gate also corrected its React paint assertion to inspect authoritative logical instance counts rather than unused retained-capacity slots. Compact option forwarding makes browser core and every first-party runtime closure 55 raw / 49 minified bytes smaller than the parent; compressed changes range from −74 to +76 bytes. All validator, baker-host, and Wasm artifacts remain byte-identical.
- **Bounded retained raster capacity** — Completed roadmap item 10.3 by giving Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug deterministic 25% instance slack capped at 256 glyphs, separate logical draw counts, complete in-place parallel-field replacement, transactional overflow/topology replacement, and shared 32-instance dirty buckets with an eight-range full-upload fallback. Unconsumed Three.js update ranges carry into later stages. Focused tests prove arbitrary glyph replacement, shrink, exact-capacity growth, retained object/buffer identity, abort preservation, overflow disposal, Bitmap/Slug page-run changes, and color-only preservation; existing Text and Slug lifecycle suites remain green. Browser core, every baker host, and every Wasm artifact remain byte-identical. Optional Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug closures grow by 5,155/2,779/627/598, 6,038/3,148/778/762, and 9,309/4,976/1,238/1,204 raw/minified/gzip/Brotli bytes, respectively, without changing existing absolute budgets.
- **Warm Presentation publication and continuity** — Published resident `Text` replacements from the Three.js matrix-update lifecycle and removed Icon Grid's hide-and-await recycling path: pooled tiles retain their old complete glyph until one coherent warm assignment is staged and published. Ordinary Text Ladder playback keeps visible content while the timed demo alone owns its authored off-screen exit. The persistent host now ignores identical resize requests and keeps its provider-owned canvas attached across replacement-effect handoffs; benchmark DPR no longer keys a subtree remount. Split the DPR-2 evidence lanes so headless pixel sampling cannot flash a visible GPU canvas while the headful timed demo runs without screenshots. Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug each complete all seven sequential workloads with visible pixels and one renderer; the headful timed sequence completes at 60.02 Icon Grid FPS, returns to Off-axis / 3D, and emits no warnings. A focused regression hides the zero-vertex screen grid during the temporary 1×1 pre-layout surface instead of submitting an empty WebGPU draw.
- **Lifecycle-owned warm publication** — Added synchronous cache peeks for registered font loads, initialized shapers, and current decoded raster resources. Resident `Text` updates now shape, lay out, plan paint, and stage without crossing a Promise boundary, retain the previous generation until Three.js object traversal, and publish before raster children. React Suspense continues to own genuinely cold preparation; the React integration performs no consumer `ready` wait and explicitly invalidates its R3F root after core updates. Asynchronous plugin preparation is carried forward under one abort controller rather than probed and restarted. Adversarial findings led to shared staging logic, paint-only layout/page reuse, abort propagation across multi-font preparation, valid replacement preservation after superseded-font disposal, both Three matrix-update entry points, and defensive sibling traversal after a plugin violates the infallible-commit contract. The complete browser conformance lane proves 3/3 exact R3F reconciliations through explicit renderer traversal and 3/3 exact 68-frame Advanced Shaping timelines with five cold observations, 63 warm lifecycle publications, and zero warm readiness waits per sample; the packed consumer remains exact. Against the preceding transaction layer, browser core grows by 8,070 raw / 5,005 minified / 966 gzip / 795 Brotli bytes; Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug runtime closures grow by 8,064/4,998/1,055/755, 8,064/4,998/1,065/808, and 8,064/4,997/973/657 bytes respectively. Baker hosts and Wasm remain byte-identical.
- **Renderer-neutral raster transaction** — Started Milestone 10 by replacing the optional Bitmap-only retained-update seam plus separate build/repaint methods with one required `stageBatch` lifecycle for every raster. The portable batch contract no longer imports Three.js; the Three-backed `Text` adapter validates attachment separately. Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug now share stage/commit/abort ownership, and focused evidence proves success, injected failure, stale abort, idempotent stage transitions, and preservation of the live scene. Against the closed Milestone 6/8 head, browser core grows by 1,747 raw / 1,053 minified / 207 gzip / 144 Brotli bytes; Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug runtime closures grow by 2,100/1,253/261/253, 2,783/1,524/345/272, and 2,102/1,256/274/274 bytes respectively. Baker hosts and Wasm remain byte-identical. Only the browser-core raw/minified absolute ceilings and the pre-coverage caps for closures containing the new lifecycle advance; compressed absolute ceilings remain unchanged.
- **Milestone 6/8 closure** — Closed Milestones 6 and 8 after the deferred combined adversarial review, independent remediation of every actionable lifecycle finding, exact size/provenance refresh, 182 package integration tests, 257 benchmark unit tests, complete headless conformance, packed-consumer execution, and zero-error OKF validation. Milestone 10 is now the next authorized implementation milestone.
- **Scoped Text invalidation recovery** — Bound terminal font-disposal state to the invalidated generation's input rather than a newer replacement already in flight, and clear that saved state on explicit disposal. A two-registry regression proves disposing a superseded font cannot permanently suppress recovery through the healthy replacement font.
- **Lifecycle payload refresh** — Refreshed the single-build package-size identity and its fail-closed autoresearch provenance after the final `Text` invalidation fixes. Browser core grows by 678 raw / 391 minified / 75 gzip / 106 Brotli bytes; optional baker hosts and Wasm artifacts remain byte-identical. The browser core's reviewed raw ceiling moves from 330,000 to 331,000 bytes. The independent pre-coverage caps advance only for browser core and the Bitmap/MTSDF runtime closures that contain it, with 13–120 bytes of headroom over current values; every absolute minified/compressed budget and every baker/Wasm limit is unchanged.
- **Committed Text invalidation identity** — Paint-only updates now mutate generation state without replacing the wrapper keyed by font-disposal listeners. A regression proves font disposal still removes painted batches and that semantic no-ops preserve terminal invalidation rather than scheduling a doomed retry.
- **Scoped contributor toolchains** — Reduced the root mise install to Node, pnpm, and stable Rust; moved Meson and Ninja into the benchmark workload that provisions authenticated HarfBuzz utilities. Pnpm remains the single command surface, contributors may supply matching versions directly, non-interactive agents use `mise exec --`, and CI explicitly provisions and verifies the optional fixture gate without hiding downloads inside the ordinary check.
- **Single coverage validation authority** — Removed unused Bitmap and MTSDF validation-context coverage fields; standalone validators now expose only the authenticated descriptor as expected coverage authority, eliminating a public input that could silently disagree.
- **Configured MTSDF outline authority** — Qualified the public four-atlas-pixel outline constant as the 64/8 default and proved a real 32/4 artifact accepts exactly two atlas pixels but rejects `2.0001`, discriminating the authenticated runtime limit from the exported default.
- **Pending Text no-op lifecycle** — Semantic no-op `Text.setProperties` calls now preserve the active cold generation, abort signal, and readiness promise, including callback-only updates that publish to the latest `onLayout`. Failed generations clear their pending ownership so the same semantic input can retry. Deterministic delayed-decode and failure regressions prove both paths without timers.
- **Thin baker diagnostics boundary** — Moved direct Wasm timing and memory observation behind a private diagnostic-only TypeScript entry while retaining the Rust phase observer behind its non-default `profiling` feature. The production package-size build now rejects diagnostic module or symbol reachability, clock calls in thin baker hosts, and profiling/timing Wasm imports or exports; packed consumers receive no diagnostic module, and the package concept records exact thin-build, diagnostic-run, and evidence-refresh commands.
- **MTSDF phase attribution** — Added a package-owned small, medium, complete, and combined profiler over the shared optimized native, direct-Wasm, and serial-Worker bake paths. Authenticated measurements isolate texel generation as the dominant phase while separately recording selection, outlines, packing, KTX2, GLB, transfer, and memory high-water evidence. The profiling-only TypeScript and Rust entry points stay outside production execution; the rebased Darwin arm64 production MTSDF baker measures 552,025 raw / 215,027 gzip / 169,041 Brotli bytes.
- **Bounded-coverage size remediation** — Removed the second derived Serde serialization graph from Bitmap and MTSDF coverage-capable bakers while preserving strict seed validation and byte-identical canonical descriptors. The measured Darwin arm64 Wasm payloads now occupy 626,940 raw / 234,735 gzip / 180,503 Brotli bytes for Bitmap and 553,190 raw / 215,142 gzip / 169,365 Brotli bytes for MTSDF. Dedicated pre-coverage growth gates bound the remaining strict decoder, cmap-resolution, and canonical-policy cost. Bitmap runtime decode now also derives the canonical policy key from authenticated strikes and coverage before creating GPU resources, matching the existing MTSDF boundary.

## 2026-07-31

- **React Doctor closure** — Removed the unused interactive-canvas component and runtime canvas-settings hook. The benchmark-local full-scan configuration excludes only Vitexec entrypoints, three URL-loaded evidence modules, and one dynamically imported digest export that static reachability cannot observe. React Doctor completes with zero errors, warnings, affected files, or diagnostics while retaining all live application rules.
- **Fresh-checkout HarfBuzz bootstrap** — Added an exact root pipx pin before the existing pipx-backed Meson pin, so `mise install` no longer assumes an ambient pipx executable. The minimal Rust toolchain declares Cargo explicitly instead of relying on an implicit profile component that was absent from a fresh Linux mise cache. The macOS prerequisite now names both Homebrew `glib` and `pkgconf`, making the required `glib-2.0` metadata discoverable when the authenticated HarfBuzz fixture workflow configures its pinned utilities.
- **Milestone 8.6 regeneration** — Regenerated the affected ABIs, optimized Wasm modules, baked fixtures, identities, size records, autoresearch provenance, and package digests. The complete Rust, TypeScript, Node/Worker, artifact, renderer, conformance, live-product, and packed-consumer sweep passes locally; the four independently valid stack layers pass the clean Linux CI gate in 19m16s, 18m29s, 18m32s, and 19m13s.
- **Host-scoped MTSDF admission evidence** — Labeled the compiled admission-module measurement by platform and architecture. The recorded host retains exact evidence freshness; foreign hosts must rebuild, reproduce the portable contract and synthetic output, retain zero imports, emit a complete SHA-256 identity, and remain under reviewed raw/optimized/gzip/Brotli ceilings. Focused contract tests reject stale portable fields, incomplete hashes, and budget overflow.
- **Coverage-era size gates** — Reconciled the package-size record and its fail-closed autoresearch provenance with bounded raster coverage. Narrow current-capability ceilings pair with an independent regression that preserves the pre-coverage browser core, Bitmap host, MTSDF host, and MTSDF Wasm baselines and caps each accepted raw, minified, gzip, and Brotli delta.
- **Portable raster fixture identity** — Removed the Bitmap fixture's host-specific optimized-Wasm byte count from its portable artifact identity. The integration gate still executes the rebuilt baker and requires every canonical artifact, record, page, and report byte to match; compiled-module hash and size remain host-labeled package-size evidence under reviewed foreign-host ceilings.
- **Adjacent-texel SIMD decision** — Extended the existing MTSDF SIMD runner with an equivalent four-texel scalar tile and a four-neighbor line-distance SIMD candidate while preserving the exact scalar quadratic/cubic solvers. Every native-oracle candidate hash and complete-Inter identity remains exact with no warm Wasm memory growth. Adjacent SIMD improves the bounded Node and Chromium corpora by 2.4% and 0.9%, but complete Inter is indistinguishable warm at 45.068 versus 45.066 seconds while optimized/Brotli size grows 20.7%/11.4%. Scalar tile improves bounded Node by 10.1% but regresses Chromium by 1.5% and complete Inter warm by 1.4% while growing optimized/Brotli size 20.0%/10.9%. Machine-checked structured observations derive those deltas from the retained variants. Scalar remains the sole shipped kernel. Remapped experiment roots retain exact byte identity on the recorded host; foreign hosts reproduce all portable quality, allocation, target-feature, and zero-import contracts under reviewed per-variant size ceilings.
- **Package artifact identity** — Extended the existing single-build package-size lane with SHA-256 identities for each measured minified JavaScript payload and emitted Wasm module. Refreshed the stale Darwin arm64 size evidence from a clean reproducible build without adding a second artifact build to CI.
- **Claude Code agent compatibility** — Added a checked-in root `CLAUDE.md` bootstrap for Claude Desktop plus a startup hook that discovers nested repository `AGENTS.md` files, preserves local Claude-specific guidance while adding sibling `@AGENTS.md` imports, and exposes applicable canonical `.agents/skills` directories through generated Claude project-skill links. The dependency-free erasable-TypeScript synchronizer treats the root bootstrap as an immutable precondition, excludes the Claude-invoking `claude-review` skill, uses directory junctions on Windows, refuses to overwrite non-generated skill directories, prunes only stale links back into the canonical skill root, and has deterministic filesystem contract tests. Generated nested `CLAUDE.md` files and `.claude/skills` links remain local and ignored.
- **Presentation cadence and full-catalog Icon Grid motion** — Recut timed playback to put Off-axis / 3D, Icon Grid, and Paint & Effects inside the first four seconds, give Zoom Text and the returning Icon Grid longer holds than Dynamic Layout, place Text Ladder before a nine-second second Icon Grid run from a different position and reverse direction, and finish the 60-second run with an 8.016-second Off-axis / 3D outro. Text Ladder now owns its exact 7.2-second animation-completion interval and carries the 1024 px specimen completely through the left edge at the cut; Advanced Shaping resets to CJK, types at 180 grapheme units per second, and receives exactly one complete authored five-case cycle. Its retained MTSDF registry derives the admission ceiling from authenticated fixture lengths, allowing the exact 94,640,148-byte Amiri artifact that the generic 64 MiB ceiling had rejected while retaining length/hash checks. Icon Grid smooths observed frame deltas while retaining full 1,402-glyph traversal and overscanned-pool reassignment. A named allocation/frame profiler records heap range, recycle count, frame cadence, and a browser performance trace; a measured scale-zero visibility experiment increased retained heap range without improving cadence and was rejected.
- **Continuous word and script handoffs** — Made Zoom Text clear an aborted preparation marker and retry the same recycled slot instead of holding one word for a complete extra cycle. Font-changing Advanced Shaping transitions deliberately blank the live line until the next authenticated generation commits, avoiding mismatched old-script frames while same-font grapheme updates remain continuous.

## 2026-07-30

- **Presentation demo input and state isolation** — Captured the Space playback shortcut at the window boundary without stealing spaces from editable text, prevented focused controls from receiving the matching activation, and compared timed-demo frames against requested rather than committed location state. The Off-axis / 3D to Icon Grid handoff now issues one preload request and applies Icon Grid's complete runtime defaults before commit. A hardware-browser demo probe reproduces the focused-control path and requires the retained canvas, one renderer, exact Icon Grid controls, live geometry, and advancing telemetry.
- **Continuous Presentation visibility** — Reproduced the reported sequential black frame after the original settled-frame probe passed: Text Ladder moved its final 1024 px specimen completely beyond the viewport during its cycle hold. The marquee now aligns that specimen's trailing edge inside the viewport, a pure geometry regression covers the complete interpolation, and the package-owned browser probe samples the unobstructed render region throughout every workload interval. Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug each completed all seven selector-driven workloads with one retained renderer and no blank sample.
- **Sequential Presentation isolation** — Made workload transitions install a complete view/layout/animation/paint default snapshot, prevented the outgoing Paragraph Stress RAF from overwriting the requested workload, and atomically replaced workload-local camera and transform state without replacing the route renderer. A package-owned Playwright probe clicks all seven Presentation workloads in order, requires one canvas and renderer, validates the applied defaults and camera projection, rejects browser warnings, and measures visible foreground pixels so a telemetry-valid black frame cannot pass.
- **Presentation completion and pacing** — Serialized pre-activation Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug updates through a latest-value drain, scoped Bitmap glyph assertions to the committed workload, composed rapid URL controls against the latest requested state, prevented concurrent Icon-grid recycling during retained size changes, and made the complete Presentation sweep wait for workload-specific telemetry and the full Advanced-shaping specimen. WebGPU and forced WebGL2 both completed all 27 technique/workload cells at approximately 60 RAF frames per second with p95 frame intervals below 18.7 milliseconds; the changed benchmark scope reports React Doctor 100/100.
- **Exclusive finite renderer jobs** — Routed explicit conformance execution and follow-up visual captures through the route host's serialized renderer-job boundary. Source-outline and runtime-fallback targets now honor the shared renderer and abort signal, retained scenes resume after job success, failure, or cancellation, and the focused WebGPU/WebGL product probe requires one canvas identity plus peak renderer concurrency of one across aborted and successful captures.
- **Async retained scene transitions** — Gave each route and backend generation one persistent canvas, renderer, animation loop, GPU timer, and telemetry history. Workload and technique selections preload through a React resource, commit inside a transition after the async boundary, keep the current scene visible while the replacement activates, and let the nearest Suspense boundary own genuinely cold loading. Compatible font changes update retained `Text` instances in place. The realtime MSDF / Slug comparison now borrows that host as a retained scene, while finite Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, source-outline, and runtime-fallback captures borrow it as exclusive jobs that restore renderer state after success or failure. A live WebGPU probe changed Slug to MSDF in 15 animation frames while preserving the renderer canvas and all three graph canvases without exposing either loading UI; Off-axis / 3D to Icon Grid preserved the same canvas and settled in 14 frames.
- **Advanced-shaping frame cadence** — Removed the 65 ms typewriter throttle from the live Advanced Shaping workload. Playing state now advances one grapheme per application animation frame, so a 60 Hz display continuously exercises shaping and layout at up to 60 updates per second while pause, scrub, and exact grapheme boundaries remain unchanged.
- **Off-axis content control** — Replaced the four forced lines with one continuously wrapping Off-axis / 3D paragraph, set its content box default to the viewport-neutral 100%, and exposed a distinct 40–200% content-width slider in both Main and Presentation. Wider settings can now send the line beyond the viewport and visibly down the perspective plane instead of preserving a multiline slab.
- **Stable FPS domain and shuffled Zoom corpus** — Replaced the telemetry refresh ceiling's single-interval high-water with a robust retained-period estimate, keeping 60 FPS at the top of a 60 Hz graph despite startup jitter. Expanded Zoom Text to 16 unique Inter-covered translations across Latin Extended, Greek, and Cyrillic; each page starts with `Shape` and shuffles the remaining phrases once without replacement for a shared three-technique order.
- **Presentation control dock** — Replaced the expandable form panel and application-owned listbox behavior with official shadcn components backed by Base UI. A viewport-anchored segmented dock exposes one contextual popover per dynamic workload control, uses multiline panels for selection and text entry, omits unavailable technique controls, and retains Koota as the single app-boundary state owner. Base UI now owns outside press, Escape, focus restoration, portal positioning, and keyboard behavior. Presentation surfaces share tighter corners; MTSDF paint defaults to zero stroke with shadow off.
- **Retained Bitmap layout buffers** — Added transactional raster batch staging so real font-size changes still reshape and re-layout while compatible Bitmap generations retain geometry, UVs, textures, materials, colors, and draw objects. Same-strike updates independently upload changed origin and size attributes; incompatible glyph/page topology retains the established rebuild fallback. The package-owned Paragraph Stress rendered-size profile improved from 5.14 to 19.39 RAF FPS, isolating the remaining cost to paragraph work and the existing 560-draw topology rather than GPU execution.
- **Reproducible benchmark commands** — Promoted the retained Paragraph Stress profile and complete Presentation framerate sweep from temporary Vitexec probes into package-owned workflows with short root `pnpm` aliases. Added a root benchmark check lane and OKF digest command, documented the maintainer entry points, and guided repository agents to encode repeatable workflows before running them.
- **Benchmark runtime state** — Moved live controls and React-facing telemetry from the root harness into coherent Koota world traits while keeping Koota app-local. A dedicated world-instance module preserves identity across component Fast Refresh, the prop-free application child no longer subscribes to hot state, and typed telemetry histories remain renderer-owned while React summaries publish four times per second.
- **Retained paragraph width** — Changed compatible layout-width and viewport-width updates from complete scene/Text replacement to retained `Text.setProperties({ width })`, latest-value queue coalescing, and committed-entry repositioning. The same six-second Paragraph Stress sweep improved from 26.82 to 113.97 RAF FPS, reduced p95 frame time from 43.1 to 9.8 milliseconds, and produced no long tasks in the uninstrumented post-change run.
- **Benchmark selection controls** — Restored button-based font fixtures in Main and compact controls, kept their rail content-height until a half-region cap requires contained scrolling, and replaced Presentation's native workload/font selects with compact application-owned listbox popovers shared with the controls panel.
- **Benchmark isolation and allocation hardening** — Made Presentation an exclusive root presentation with no hidden Main or Conformance subtree, added one-renderer lifecycle diagnostics and rapid-switch coverage, removed duplicate React live-stat ownership, eliminated common telemetry ring and empty-poll allocations, retained Paint & Effects source spans and dynamic-workload scratch storage, reused `Text` glyph-paint topology, added an MTSDF color-only update path, and made renderer teardown await outstanding WebGPU timestamps.

## 2026-07-29

- **Buffered telemetry presentation** — Moved the shared FPS/CPU/GPU chart head 250 milliseconds behind the renderer RAF clock so asynchronously polled GPU measurements normally settle into their original timestamped slots before display rather than visibly catching up. The delay affects presentation only: rendering, measurement, polling, and the eight-second history remain unchanged. FPS history now smooths frame duration with a 250-millisecond time-based exponential average before converting to a rate, while CPU/GPU timings and the observed refresh-rate ceiling stay unsmoothed. CPU timing now begins at renderer callback entry and includes completed-query polling plus workload animation/update before render submission; it explicitly excludes external React/browser work, presentation, compositing, and RAF wait time.
- **Timestamped RAF telemetry** — Decoupled CPU and FPS history from delayed GPU query delivery through a 1,024-frame shared timestamp ring. Every frame receives the latest resolved GPU duration; one-resolution-at-a-time WebGPU sampling uses Three's resolved renderer-frame identity to refresh the still-pending slots, while WebGL polls its per-frame queries on the renderer RAF. The three canvases now scroll one shared eight-second time domain continuously without interpolating sample heights, restarting an easing transition, or reducing GPU to a sparse series. Presentation floating surfaces consistently use 80%-black composition with opaque borders, and the telemetry rail owns one real background plus opaque dividers.
- **Icon-grid submission containment** — Kept three-row/column overscan assignments warm for flash-free recycling while hiding every tile outside the exact viewport from Three's render traversal. At a 1,280×1,280 profile viewport, Main retains 221 assigned tiles but submits 60, reducing draws from 442 to 120; Presentation retains 340 but submits 130, reducing draws from 680 to 260. Static tile-local transforms now opt out of per-frame matrix recomputation while the panned scene transform remains dynamic. Six WebGPU profiles across Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug held about 120 FPS with zero long tasks and reduced median CPU submit from 1.8–3.0 milliseconds to 1.3–1.9 milliseconds. Compatible independent `Text` objects remain separate draws; transparent renderer-level auto-batching is future work.
- **Viewport-scaled Benchmark workloads** — Gave screen-bounded Benchmark paragraphs a deterministic authored width floor that pans on smaller canvases and expands inside a shared viewport inset on larger canvases. Resize now separates camera and surface updates from content-width changes, so fixed-width resize ranges and the intrinsic Text Ladder avoid unnecessary paragraph rebuilds. Icon Grid retains intrinsic two-axis virtualization, fixed-size labels, and logarithmic icon scaling while remapping the grid coordinate under the viewport center across scale changes.
- **Autoresearch evidence refresh** — Regenerated the disabled V0 autoresearch baseline after the full benchmark gate detected that its recorded package-size digest no longer matched the canonical package-size artifact. The fail-closed check now authenticates the current 5,145-byte size record instead of carrying stale provenance.
- **Presentation-scale Presentation chrome** — Enlarged Presentation's top controls, telemetry and Controls stack, and payload pills through one 1.5× presentation-scale boundary. The payload hierarchy uses 11 CSS px native accent-purple labels, white numeric values and byte units, and muted compression/GPU qualifiers, yielding 16.5 CSS px presentation text. Each floating group uses inverse-scale viewport constraints, an explicit transform origin, and a 32 CSS px presentation safe area, so the larger chrome stays clear of rounded host-frame corners and inside a 1,280×1,280 viewport without overlapping adjacent groups while the canvas remains the visual subject. The shared renderer grid keeps its one-pixel geometry and draw path while moving from `#3f3f4a` to the brighter neutral `#50505c`.
- **Bounded workload rail** — Split Main mode's left rail into fixed technique and font-fixture boundaries around an independently scrolling workload list. Alpha fades track whether content remains before or after the current scroll position, and the font fixture stays visible while workloads move beneath its edge.
- **Retained multilingual zoom** — Added a fixed-Inter Zoom Text workload across Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug. Eleven pre-shaped, language-tagged translations of “Shape” cycle only at the 8 pt boundary while one visible node scales from 10.67 CSS px to its word-specific viewport fit; live WebGPU and WebGL probes report one draw, zero missing glyphs, one initial text update, zero animation reflows, and retained resize fitting.
- **Presentation chrome density** — Unified the floating technique and select controls at one compact 32 CSS px, 70%-black boundary with no backdrop filters, replaced the text entry action with an accessible expand-corners icon, added explicit trailing select and accordion chevrons, removed the visible exit action in favor of Escape, moved telemetry into the freed top-right corner, hid canvas captions and navigation status from the presentation surface, and reduced the three-graph stack to 160 CSS px on desktop. The live GPU probe proves equal outer control heights, advancing FPS/CPU/GPU telemetry, absent exit chrome, retained renderer identity through Escape and re-entry, and a settled 119.9 FPS observation.
- **Retained Presentation renderer** — Replaced the Main/Presentation host-tree swap with one structural scene slot whose chrome and geometry change in place. A causal GPU-browser probe preserves the exact comparison viewport, canvas, and renderer initialization across both transitions while expanding the retained MTSDF Icon Grid surface from 709×373 to 1,280×720 CSS pixels.
- **Canonical schema formatter boundary** — Excluded the canonical PMNDRS extension schema JSON and the font-baker's authenticated schema tree from hand-formatting alongside the packaged text runtime copies, then restored exact byte identity between each canonical schema and packaged validator input. Focused core font, Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug integration gates now protect schema authority from presentation-only drift.
- **Render controls boundary** — Moved the parity-preserved Main/Presentation render controls and detailed payload/resource inspector out of the harness. The extracted boundary owns control-only workload descriptions, authenticated fixture lookup, package-size accounting, disclosure rows, and Presentation's minimal-mode filtering; `app.tsx` now keeps the state transitions and passes typed values/callbacks across that boundary.
- **Responsive shell boundary** — Moved the parity-preserved tablet controls sheet, compact workload panel, and mobile bottom navigation out of the benchmark harness so the harness retains state and renderer lifecycle ownership while layout-specific chrome remains independently maintainable.
- **Benchmark Presentation Mode** — Added a canonical URL-backed `main`/`presentation` presentation axis without changing renderer ownership or live-scene keys. Presentation makes the workload canvas the fixed viewport, floats the technique/workload/font controls without a header container, stacks synchronized telemetry in a translucent right rail, exposes a collapsed Backend/DPR/workload-only controls accordion, and reports the active runtime/font/GPU payload as bottom-right pills. Main retains its existing desktop/tablet/mobile shell and gains one explicit Presentation entry action.
- **Benchmark presentation boundaries** — Began the two-layout benchmark refactor without changing the existing shell: the technique selector and synchronized telemetry renderer now live behind reusable components, while a pure payload-summary boundary preserves technique-specific transfer/GPU accounting, runtime bake costs, stale-stat rejection, and Icon Grid's icon-plus-label font aggregation for the forthcoming Presentation overlays.
- **Repository formatter authority** — Replaced the benchmark and Glyph package-local Oxfmt policies with one root configuration. Authored code and documentation now share a 120-column, semicolon-enabled, single-quote, trailing-comma style from every working directory; compiler-generated sources and authenticated fixtures remain byte-preserved exclusions rather than formatter inputs.
- **Synchronized frame telemetry** — Bound FPS, CPU submit, and GPU duration to one sampled frame identity and one shared 240-sample ring cursor. WebGPU asynchronously resolves Three timestamps while WebGL polls extension query availability and disjoint state; both deliver results through the renderer RAF without timers or a second animation loop. The three canvases share one drawing RAF, fixed refresh-rate/frame-budget domains, and one eased horizontal transition. Current values sit beside compact labels, unlabeled extrema remain at the top right, and near-zero values occupy the visible chart floor. The responsive shell now fills the remaining dynamic viewport while locking page scroll and overscroll; only designated rails, sheets, reports, and inspectors scroll independently.
- **Retained icon scaling** — Split each virtual icon tile into independent icon and fixed-size label `Text` generations. Interactive size changes now rebuild only the visible one-glyph icon batches and incrementally resize the existing overscanned pool, rather than reshaping every unchanged label and replacing the complete scene for each slider value.
- **Icon-grid font accounting** — Corrected the reporting boundary to match the renderer's existing two-font scene. Live DOM evidence, captures, and reports now name Font Awesome as the primary icon fixture and retain the selected family as the label fixture; baked payload and fallback GPU-resource totals include both authenticated fonts while runtime totals continue to use the renderer's combined measurements.
- **Packed-consumer fixture** — Chrome 150 began requesting `/favicon.ico` for the synthetic packed-tarball consumer after its Worker had already returned the exact artifact; the fixture's strict console gate correctly exposed Vite's incidental 404. The document now declares a self-contained data-URL favicon, and future browser-resource failures retain their console source or HTTP status, resource type, and URL instead of collapsing to an unidentified 404.
- **Activity canvas handoff** — Traced WebKit's `null is not an object (evaluating 'array[offset]')` to Three's WebGL state initialization: a reconnected React Activity reused the same DOM canvas after Three had deliberately lost its context, so `SCISSOR_BOX` and `VIEWPORT` were null before `Vector4.fromArray`. Mode transitions now replace the renderer subtree's canvas while preserving Activity-owned navigation state; serialized teardown still prevents overlapping live renderers.
- **HarfBuzz CLI prerequisite** — Corrected the assumption that pinned Meson and Ninja alone make upstream HarfBuzz utilities available. HarfBuzz 13 creates `hb-shape` and `hb-subset` only with GLib development metadata; the provisioner now requires that dependency during Meson configuration, while the Ubuntu 24.04 job installs `libglib2.0-dev` explicitly and reports its resolved version. Unrelated optional backends are disabled so the source-build graph does not vary with ambient host libraries; the authenticated HarfBuzz engine and exact subset-byte gate remain unchanged.
- **WebGL renderer handoff** — Reproduced rapid Benchmark/Conformance switching in WebKit as a null WebGL2 context followed by Three.js retrying its rejected initialization from `setAnimationLoop(null)`. All benchmark renderer owners now use one disposal boundary that stops rendering, invokes Three's synchronous cleanup, and waits for the browser's actual `webglcontextlost` event before the exclusive lifecycle admits a replacement. Failed initialization releases an acquired WebGL context without re-entering Three initialization. This established causal context release but did not make React Activity's preserved canvas reusable; the Activity canvas handoff above completes that boundary.
- **Icon-grid resize and teardown** — Stopped treating every viewport notification as a full virtual-grid rebuild. Resize now retains the existing `Text` pool while its capacity is unchanged, recycles only the newly exposed window, and reserves a serialized replacement for actual capacity changes. Comparison teardown also stops its animation loop before awaiting outstanding text work, preventing a hidden or replaced workload from continuing background frame submissions.
- **Rolling Chromium CI canary** — Replaced CI's Playwright browser download with explicit discovery of the GitHub Ubuntu runner's rolling system Chromium. One package-owned launcher routes every direct Playwright launch through an optional project-specific executable path while preserving the managed local default, logs the actual launched version, and adds that exact value beside the potentially reduced user agent in headless benchmark summaries. Focused Node tests protect both branches and reject an empty override; historical Chromium 149 fixture names and goldens remain unchanged.
- **HarfBuzz build-tool authority** — The clean-checkout Japanese subset gate exposed that authenticated HarfBuzz source provisioning still depended on an ambient `meson` executable absent from GitHub's Ubuntu runner. The root mise toolchain now installs exact Meson 1.11.1 and Ninja 1.13.2 pins, preserving HarfBuzz's supported source build and the fresh byte-for-byte subset check without an operating-system package step or a platform-specific binary.
- **Observable Claude review workflow** — Added the repository-local `claude-review` skill for read-only external-model audits. Its launcher keeps tool activity and completed responses visible while retaining the exact prompt, complete structured event stream, final report, diagnostics, commit/model/effort metadata, timing, usage, cost, and exit state under the ignored `.cache/claude-review/` tree. Review results remain probes that require local reproduction before code changes or promotion into canonical knowledge.
- **Clean-checkout CI prerequisites** — Fixed two producer-lifecycle defects exposed by consecutive GitHub Actions runs. ABI capture had resolved on child `exit`, which can precede stdout EOF; the failing run therefore parsed a successful producer's empty buffer. A shared capture boundary now resolves on `close`, and a causal subprocess regression observes zero bytes at exit versus the complete 65,559-byte JSON payload at stream close. The next clean run reached the benchmark fixture layer and exposed an unrelated ignored-cache assumption: the Japanese subset check invoked a missing local `hb-subset`. That check now provisions and authenticates exact HarfBuzz 13.0.0 before fresh regeneration, making the package's declared check sufficient on a new checkout.
- **TypeScript declaration fix** — Carried DefinitelyTyped PR 75246 as a pnpm patch over `@types/three` 0.185.1, replacing the nested `Node<TNodeType>` conditional tree identified by TypeScript Go issue 4528 with a behaviorally equivalent `NodeExtras` lookup. The permanent regression now compiles the formerly explosive method chain, uint shifts and bitwise operations, integer division/modulo, vector `fwidth`, and object-form `Loop` in 215 milliseconds at 4 MiB peak RSS. Package and application projects complete normally, so the native compiler process guard, its AGENTS requirement, and its skill/package/build integrations were removed.
- **Portable MTSDF framebuffer gate** — Corrected the headless conformance lane after it compared Playwright SwiftShader pixels with a hash captured through Apple Metal. Both paths were Chromium 149 on the same host, but filtered analytic coverage was not byte-identical. MTSDF scenes now require within-renderer determinism and exact structural/resource invariants, while the companion scalar reconstruction owns reviewed pixel-error limits. The three-sample SwiftShader comparison passes at `0.0957/255` mean error, maximum error `10`, and 3,233 threshold pixels; hardware hashes remain observations rather than portable goldens.
- **Darwin size evidence refresh** — Regenerated the exact package-size record on the pinned Node 24.18.0, pnpm 11.15.1, Rust 1.97.1 Darwin arm64 toolchain and refreshed its dependent autoresearch source hashes. The historical same-run Slug outline-removal delta remains separately identified rather than being recomputed across host observations.
- **Slug exact-outline removal** — Removed the dynamic closest-distance outline from the Slug runtime after the retained 268-glyph scene measured `2.44×–4.33×` fill-only GPU time across WebGPU/WebGL2 and DPR 1/2. Slug V0 now rejects every outline or shadow paint property before allocation or mutation; MTSDF retains the generic outline API. A dedicated research concept preserves the rejected algorithm, generated-program defects, public implementation survey, and a go/no-go gate for one bounded shared-traversal approximation whose quality must be no worse than MTSDF and whose cost must stay near fill.
- **Realtime MSDF / Slug comparison** — Stopped conformance navigation from automatically entering the synchronous scalar CPU-reference loops that blocked the browser and let stale captures cross technique labels. Finite captures now begin only after an explicit run. Added an editable live comparison that renders aligned MSDF and Slug scenes into equal RGBA8 targets, samples both targets in one TSL fullscreen pass, and presents the candidates plus an 8× signed red/cyan coverage heatmap without readback or CPU composition. The permanent hardware probe commits custom text transactionally to both layouts, zooms to 4×, switches to finite conformance in under 8 milliseconds across retained runs without auto-starting it, rejects a completed run that crosses workloads, and returns to the live WebGPU comparison; forced WebGL2 also initializes without shader or validation errors.
- **MTSDF direct browser gate refreshed** — The current WebGPU base-level scenario produces framebuffer hash `4da56d…`, 14,400 changed pixels, 2,420 colors, and a 6,798,412-byte compressed artifact. Forced WebGL2 produces `8cbb665b…b912`; both independent scalar comparisons stay below `0.0186` mean absolute error with maximum error `1` and zero threshold error pixels. The renderer output passed; the failing scenario gate was stale mip-era evidence that still expected the removed path's wording, compressed size, and WebGL2 pixels, so the assertion now follows the authenticated base-level artifact rather than misattributing the mismatch to rendering.
- **Authenticated MTSDF bake quality** — Exposed integer `emSize` and full `pixelRange` controls without changing the 64/8 recommendation or its established raster key. Omitted or partial options resolve against 64/8; explicit effective 64/8 canonicalizes to the legacy fieldless descriptor, while non-default identities carry both effective values. The artifact fixes `planeUnitsPerEm` to `emSize` and uses `ceil(pixelRange / 2)` padding so odd ranges remain contained. Real 155-glyph subset bakes at 32/4 and 32/6 pass semantic validation, proving the configurable path while leaving comparative quality and payload benchmarking open. The existing low-level Wasm ABI is unchanged. The added host options measure 15,430 minified / 4,701 gzip / 4,176 Brotli bytes, and the full baker Wasm measures 534,709 raw bytes; the reviewed host ceiling now includes that authenticated configuration surface.
- **Milestone 9 Slug closure** — Closed the port after mapping conversion, exact packing, public runtime/outline, six benchmark workloads, 36 release-role cells, seven-source quality/performance matrices, the complete icon-font grid, resource/payload reporting, and non-Slug graph isolation to an explicit roadmap checklist. The applicable older-fork baseline optimizations ship; fixed/adaptive bands, packed hulls, and per-root branching retain staged rejection packets instead of shipping alternate format or shader branches. The `{16,32,64}` policy stops at its authenticated storage gate and makes no pixel or GPU claim; candidates that reach rendering retain exact quality and complete dual-backend decisions.
- **Fully external Slug framebuffer parity** — Freshly baked Inter into a core GLB, external Slug companion, and separate curve/header/reference files, then loaded them through public `FontLoader` URL resolution and public `Text`. WebGPU and forced WebGL2 frames are byte-identical to the embedded fixture with equal 84-glyph / 470,202-curve work; the retained request log proves every external resource was fetched and authenticates all five transient outputs before cleanup.
- **Slug outline framebuffer authority** — Added a four-cell Chromium 149 check over WebGPU and forced WebGL2 at DPR 1/2. Explicit zero-width outline remains byte-identical to fill-only; an 8-physical-pixel positive outline expands `OQag` by exactly eight pixels on every side and matches the independent CPU stroke reference at `0.00277/255` mean error, 17 maximum byte error, 17 error pixels, and zero severe pixels. A deliberately wrong fill-only reference records about `20.836/255` mean error.
- **Icon-font comparison workload** — Added the licensed 1,402-glyph Font Awesome Free Solid 6.7.2 catalog to Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug. The live workload presents a 38-by-37 two-axis plane with fixed centered labels, logarithmic 8–1,024 CSS-pixel icon scaling, viewport-relative three-row/column overscan, and transactional `Text` recycling. The product probe traverses both axes to the final icon and back with zero missing glyphs while retaining 143 pooled entries at its standard viewport.
- **Glyph-local MTSDF correction and quadratic solve** — Retained the upstream-compatible edge-fast correction before a bounded alpha-confirmed residual pass, both inside each glyph's tight padded rectangle. Replaced nine-start Newton approximation for quadratic distances with the pinned reference's exact stationary-point solve. Native-oracle coverage remains zero-error across seven cases; the admission square's corrected deterministic FNV-1a identity is `bfc76761`. The Font Awesome two-icon pass falls from about 392 to 170 milliseconds and its complete nine-page bake from 212.3 to 109.9 seconds on this host. Remaining scallops on complex overlapping icons at extreme magnification also reproduce in pinned native `msdfgen` at the same 64-pixel field resolution, so correction is not mislabeled as analytic-scale fidelity.
- **Corrected MTSDF evidence closure** — Synchronized the admission checksum, seven direct-host oracle identities, feature-minimal size record, and rejected-SIMD packet with the corrected kernel. Scalar remains fastest for the bounded seven-case Node/Chromium corpus at 46.462/47.6 milliseconds versus explicit SIMD at 47.079/48.1 milliseconds. Explicit SIMD now improves the complete Inter warm stress pass from 48.13 to 45.38 seconds, so item 8.6 retains that 5.7% offline result without changing the scalar bounded-runtime default or publishing an alternate artifact.

## 2026-07-28

- **Slug analytic outline** — Copied and adapted the older analytic quadratic-distance pass into one specialized fill-plus-outline material. Fill-only paint retains the original material and creates no outline buffer or pipeline; positive outline lazily adds per-instance color/width data and swaps the same mesh, while all states remain one draw. Restoring an all-zero run disposes the outlined geometry and its GPU attributes before publishing a fill-only replacement, so the steady resource cost returns to the original path and later outline paint allocates fresh instance data. A retained 128-pair same-build experiment accepts per-instance branching around analytic stroke evaluation: exact pixels and resources accompany 30.51% lower mixed-batch median paired GPU time on WebGPU and 23.96% lower time on forced WebGL2, while all-outlined guards remain below the 2% median-regression ceiling. Half-open band traversal covers every band reached by the bounded `0.05 em` width, with vertical fallback for quantized y-flat curves. A bounded `while` preserves fill's sorted-reference early exit without generated unreachable-break warnings.
- **MTSDF base-level sampling decision** — Removed runtime mip generation and trilinear cross-level sampling after review found no affirmative mipmap guidance in the primary MSDF paper or official generators and the encoded channels do not support ordinary distance-preserving averaging. MTSDF now keeps bilinear sampling plus screen-derivative reconstruction over authenticated base levels. Runtime, validator, fixture, and inspector accounting agree on padded base-array residency; canonical Inter falls from 55,924,040 to 41,943,040 GPU bytes, and the mip-level inspector row is gone. This supersedes the earlier scheduled minification campaign.
- **Slug release-role evidence** — Retained 36 Chromium 149 cells covering large text, 1,024-ppem scale, Arabic, Devanagari, CJK, viewport clipping, the older S3 37°/3×0.5 affine invariant, and the older U2 same-geometry 1×/8× zoom invariant through WebGPU and forced WebGL2 at DPR 1/2. Flat scenes pair the browser source outline with an independent scalar Slug reference; transformed scenes explicitly use source outlines without claiming a transformed scalar oracle. Physical candidate hashes remain exact across DPR, and the centered zoom specimen retains a measured one-pixel AA fringe at both scales.
- **Slug root-branch rejection** — Evaluated the older fork's deferred per-root control-flow experiment as a same-build baseline/candidate pair with exact corpus, commit provenance, resource equality, and 140 paired dual-backend sessions. All 28 quality cells and every resource remain exact. Final Three 0.185.1 programs show baseline boolean selects already emit eight root-condition branches across both axes; coalescing them to four adds 304 shader bytes, clears the 5% gate for no source on both backends, and regresses CJK WebGPU by 8.43% and Inter WebGL2 by 11.22%. The temporary selector and probes are removed; the manifest, candidate commit, final-program identities, and complete timing evidence remain retained.
- **Slug hull rejection** — Reproduced the older fork's deferred packed-hull early exit across seven source families, 28 exact-pixel cells, and 140 paired product sessions. Every output pixel remained identical, but no source cleared the 5% gate on both backends while gzip grew 29.0–44.2% and Slug residency grew 17.4–25.2%; the incompatible R32UI format and runtime branch are removed from the shipping tree, with the exact candidate commit and evidence retained.
- **Slug multi-source evidence** — Replaced fallback-heavy Latin-only probes with authored Latin, Arabic, Devanagari, and Japanese specimens; retained 28-cell dual-backend/DPR quality and performance matrices; required zero missing glyphs; recorded exact curve/header/reference residency and raw causal histories; and isolated DotGothic16's hinted Canvas envelope from the stricter analytic GPU/CPU comparison.
- **Slug fixed-band calibration** — Retained a non-shipping fixed-32 baker challenger over the immutable fixed-16 baseline. All 28 quality cells remain byte-identical and curve visits fall 12.0–19.4%; interleaved DPR-2 observations show GPU improvement signals on both backends, but universal gzip and GPU-residency growth plus noisy Japanese WebGPU pairs reject fixed 32 as the production policy and advance adaptive per-glyph bands.
- **Slug adaptive-band rejection** — Precommitted and evaluated a `{16, 32, 64}` per-glyph policy targeting six mean references per band. Artifact evidence rejects it before GPU measurement: widespread 64-band escalation grows gzip 9.7–30.2% and residency 8.6–25.0%; exact candidate hashes and selection distributions are retained so the failed threshold is not repeated.
- **Slug capped-adaptive rejection** — Retained exact 28-cell quality and 140 interleaved product runs for a separately precommitted `{16, 32}` policy. Curve visits fall 2.7–13.5%, but payload/residency growth, a 14.9% DotGothic16 WebGPU regression, and no reliable dual-backend dense-source win reject the universal policy.
- **Slug product and performance evidence** — Extended the maintained hardware-WebGPU product probe across Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug for all five shared comparison workloads; corrected stale DPR and grid-control probes; measured Slug startup, upload-frame, steady CPU/GPU, payload, and exact analytic-resource residency alongside the established rasters; and added isolated Slug runtime/host/Wasm size records plus explicit Bitmap/MTSDF graph exclusions.
- **MTSDF minification decision** — Scheduled an immediate post-Slug Milestone 10 campaign comparing no mipmaps, current upload-generated linear mipmaps, and distance-aware authored levels across a fixed small-size and transformed-text ladder. The gate measures source-outline error, neighboring-cell bleed, upload/GPU time, transport, and exact padded-array residency before implementing a winner; it also corrects standalone validator and baker-report accounting to match runtime array padding.
- **TSL compiler reduction** — Reduced repeated TypeScript 7.0.2 runaway memory to exact Three 0.185.1 overload families, including uint bitwise/arithmetic, integer division/modulo, vector derivatives, object-form loops, and unsigned texture typing. A version-pinned compatibility boundary preserves the copied Slug graph and public TSL runtime calls while bounded fixtures protect every diagnostic run.
- **Native TypeScript containment** — Replaced the defective shim-level watchdog with a repository-owned runner that resolves and supervises the pinned native TypeScript 7 executable directly, proves hard-kill and reaping against a synthetic allocator, caps tracked RSS at 2 GiB, and routes package, application, and build-script compiler entry points through the same boundary. The TSL skill now requires narrow free-function fixtures before whole-project checks.
- **Slug product integration** — Promoted Slug from an unavailable placeholder to a third dynamically loaded technique across the shared live workloads, deterministic scene and GPU/CPU sampling targets, source-outline fidelity, and baked/runtime parity. Shared product reporting now accepts Slug's exact curve/header/reference resource breakdown while retaining one comparable atlas-allocation total.
- **Slug TSL runtime correction** — Adapted exact R16UI references into paired R32UI texels for Three 0.185.1's unsigned-sampler boundary without changing the artifact or per-reference density. Restored active-stack coverage accumulation, gave the two analytic axes distinct generated declarations, and reduced the live GPU/CPU comparison from a blank frame to sub-byte mean error with clean TSL diagnostics.
- **Slug benchmark fixtures and adapter** — Added deterministic gzip-compressed Slug GLBs for all seven visual families plus one copied-and-adapted dual-backend `Text` renderer. The manifest authenticates raw and transport identities and reports bake/GPU totals; the adapter supports baked and runtime delivery and separates curve, header, reference, framebuffer, and total GPU residency. Product routing, CPU/GPU sampling comparison, source-outline panels, and performance evidence remain active Milestone 9 work.
- **Slug external residency** — Added one registered-raster resource seam for embedded views and authenticated external resources. It retains companion URL/fetch provenance or a caller resolver, bounds reads, enforces exact length and SHA-256 identity, forwards cancellation, and lets Slug decode external RGBA16F curves plus R32UI/R16UI grids transactionally without weakening other raster import boundaries.
- **Slug analytic runtime** — Copied and adapted the reviewed Three Flatland TSL coverage, dilation, winding, and stable q-form solver to exact `PMNDRS_font_slug` V0 RGBA16F/R32UI/R16UI resources. The package runtime validates fixed records, uploads exact integer textures and attributes, preserves consecutive page runs, bounds fragment traversal, owns resource disposal, and remains outside non-Slug import graphs; browser visual/performance evidence remains active Milestone 9 work.
- **Slug baker host** — Connected the deterministic Rust artifact baker to a compiler-derived V0 TypeScript ABI, the shared direct/segmented Wasm host, bounded borrowed windows, synchronous progress forwarding, and the serial lazy module-Worker boundary. Canonical Inter produces byte-equivalent embedded and independently authenticated external Slug resources; structured identity failures and allocation/result ownership have focused regressions.
- **Slug artifact validation** — Added the fixed Slug V0 identity and strict standalone validation boundary over canonical extension schemas, exact 40-byte records, exclusive buffer-view ownership, native RGBA16F KTX2 curves, integer header/reference grids, checked addresses, authenticated external resources, and bounded GPU residency. Focused negative controls cover malformed identity, record, range, padding, KTX2 descriptor, grid tail, hash, and budget cases; rendering remains active work.
- **Dynamic Talc allocator** — Replaced ABI-private `dlmalloc` with pinned `talc` 5.0.4 in the portable font baker, Bitmap baker, MTSDF baker, and HarfRust shaper. The same optimized four-module corpus saves 46,610 raw, 15,121 gzip, and 12,121 Brotli bytes while retaining artifact, ownership, cancellation, reused-Worker, and malformed-input coverage. A representative 128 MiB global arena saved no meaningful transfer bytes and raised initial Wasm memory to about 129 MiB, so global arena allocation is rejected; a request-local scratch arena remains profiling-led future work with an explicit lifetime proof.

## 2026-07-27

- **Renderer integration sequencing** — Kept Three.js/TSL as the merged v0 implementation through Slug, then scheduled the renderer-neutral direct integration extraction after all three rasters had executable resource, batching, composition, and lifetime requirements. Three.js remains a supported adapter; raw WebGPU and a possible TypeGPU adapter sit above the same boundary rather than entering shaping or layout.
- **Compiler-derived ABI layouts** — Closed the ABI portion of item 8.6 without pulling forward selective baking or performance experiments. The font baker, shaper, Bitmap baker, and MTSDF generator/artifact boundary now derive published sizes, alignments, and field offsets from fixed-width `#[repr(C)]` Rust types. Build-only Rust generators emit the portable JSON and exact typed `as const` TypeScript modules from those facts; production hosts import the generated modules, CI rejects stale output, and production Wasm carries no duplicate JSON or ABI-pointer bootstrap.
- **MTSDF acceleration scope** — Clarified that the rejected SIMD result covered one-texel four-channel quantization, not adjacent-texel curve evaluation. Item 8.6 may compare equivalent scalar and true multi-texel SIMD tile kernels after phase instrumentation, and may research a lazy TypeGPU compute baker with explicit WGSL, scalar-Wasm fallback, same-device resident output, and measured Worker readback costs.
- **Milestone 8.6 planning** — Added bounded runtime Bitmap/MTSDF atlas options, compiler-derived `#[repr(C)]` Wasm ABI layouts, complete ABI/Wasm/fixture regeneration, phase-level baker profiling, and measured allocator selection as required pre-closure work. Current evidence attributes the long complete-face MTSDF bake primarily to serial per-texel edge-distance evaluation—45.38 seconds cold and 48.13 seconds warm for the independent 2,915-glyph Inter kernel, versus 95–109 seconds for the 39,111,736-texel artifact path—while requiring instrumentation before assigning the remaining time to packing, serialization, or copies.
- **Allocator research** — Added current `talc` as a `no_std`/WebAssembly challenger beside `dlmalloc` and `rlsf`. Dynamic and arena configurations must run the complete optimized baker corpus with identical bytes, peak-memory evidence, and reused-Worker lifecycle proof; allocator microbenchmarks cannot stand in for raster-generation results.
- **ABI decision** — Accepted compiler-derived direct-memory contracts: fixed-width `#[repr(C)]` layouts, Rust `size_of`/`align_of`/`offset_of!` generation of portable JSON and typed TypeScript, freshness checks, and a full generated-resource regression sweep. This avoids both numeric layout mirrors and runtime schema/generator cost. WebAssembly's guaranteed little-endian memory order does not replace explicit byte-order handling for portable GLB, KTX2, SFNT, or extension formats.

- **CI evidence closure** — Regenerated the package-size report and its authenticated autoresearch index after the observable Worker-bake work changed the measured host graph. The runtime-baker host now measures 11,437 raw / 9,524 minified / 3,819 gzip / 3,428 Brotli bytes; its reviewed ceiling moves by at most 100 bytes per representation while the Bitmap and MTSDF runtime ceilings remain unchanged.
- **Density and lifecycle closure** — Published representative 16/32 ppem Bitmap fixtures for every benchmark font, kept 16 CSS px stable across DPR, and made renderer-selected strikes authoritative in telemetry and payload reporting. Comparison surfaces now replace their canvas only after the prior exclusive lifecycle drains, preventing disposed WebGL state from surviving technique switches. MTSDF telemetry reads the committed renderer and raster configuration, Paint & Effects excludes animation-value construction from the timed submit boundary, and comparison teardown drains outstanding GPU queries before renderer disposal.
- **Crisp live telemetry** — Replaced the responsive sparklines' fixed 180×42 backing store with observed CSS dimensions multiplied by the browser display DPR. The preallocated histories and RAF-only drawing path remain unchanged; only canvas presentation resolution changes.
- **Reviewed size movement** — Refreshed the independent package-size record after DPR strike selection, renderer-confirmed telemetry, and Worker bake progress. The explicit ceilings move only enough to admit the measured implementation, while the Bitmap and MTSDF raster-runtime ceilings remain unchanged.
- **Transfer-size clarity** — Reduced the font-asset inspector to one comparable transport value. Compressed MTSDF fixtures show gzip bytes; uncompressed Bitmap and runtime source assets show exact transferred bytes. Decoded container/raster values no longer sit beneath a compressed total, and texture allocation remains exclusively in the GPU resource card.
- **Observable long bakes** — Bitmap and MTSDF artifact bakers now declare one Rust-generated synchronous progress import. Their Worker hosts forward a versioned stage/phase/count contract without polling or main-thread work, while the renderers and shaper remain free of baker code. The benchmark presents a determinate bar from queue admission through committed font replacement and coalesces development-console output to phase changes and ten-percent buckets. The direct-memory contract tests authenticate the exact import alongside every existing export and layout.

- **Validation research** — Defined a measured admission study for Zod Mini, Valibot, Ajv standalone, and TypeBox against the existing untrusted-resource validators. The study compares exact production closures, cold and steady boundary cost, allocations, diagnostics, fuzz/malformed parity, and schema authority; no library enters a production graph unless it is no larger than the hand-written baseline and preserves every correctness and isolation gate.

- **Rust container review** — Evaluated `gltf`, `gltf-json`, `ktx2`, `ktx2_writer`, and Khronos KTX-Software against the runtime baker's `no_std + alloc`, size, error, and exact-write requirements. Retained the restricted GLB and R8/RGBA8 KTX2 serializers as package policy while keeping `ktx2` as the DFD/parser authority and the pinned Khronos validators as independent evidence; general scene models and full codec stacks remain host or future lazy-module candidates.

- **Correction** — Made `provenance.fontFaceIndex` a required unpublished V0 artifact field across the canonical and packaged PMNDRS font schemas, the validator, and exhaustive required-field coverage; no legacy compatibility exception remains.

- **Payload inspection** — Replaced the always-expanded selected-runtime and runtime-bake component lists with default-collapsed total disclosures. Fixed label, status, and byte columns keep totals and detail rows aligned; shorter labels plus a green check or gray X replace repeated loaded/unloaded prose, while a neutral SVG chevron rotates around its true center. Font assets remain immediately visible.
- **Inspector density** — Replaced the branded accent workload control with a neutral panel-direction icon, aligned payload state labels in an explicit line box, and removed the explanatory measurement-policy card whose data was already expressed by the live metrics and captured report.
- **Explicit runtime delivery** — Added `{ source, baked: null }` as the unambiguous per-request source/runtime form while preserving baked-first sibling discovery for omitted `baked`. The benchmark now switches between baked and runtime delivery, reports the complete conditional core/raster baker graphs plus generated artifact costs, and compares both rendered frames exactly. Canonical Inter produced zero differing RGBA bytes for Bitmap and MSDF in live WebGPU evidence; a core-only integration regression authenticates and attaches the generated raster without weakening public companion rules.
- **Captured system timings** — Added benchmark-owned fixed-capacity summaries for synchronous text scheduling, combined public `Text.ready` work, application scene update, total text-update elapsed time, CPU frame submission, and GPU frame time. Captured reports label P50 and P95 explicitly with update, CPU-frame, and GPU-frame sample counts; the shipped `@pmndrs/glyph` library contains no profiling hook, branch, or measurement call.
- **Benchmark responsive shell** — Split the product into explicit desktop, tablet, and phone presentations. Desktop retains a full-height collapsible workload rail and fixed inspector; tablet keeps mode and technique controls in one header plus button-anchored workload and controls popovers; phone restores persistent Scene, Controls, Report, and Export tabs at the bottom. Capture report now opens the captured report directly and exposes a Live view return action.
- **Decision** — Kept public text geometry in CSS pixels across DPR, added an integration-supplied raster pixel ratio with deterministic nearest bitmap-strike selection, rejected RGB(A) density packing in favor of independently resident grayscale strikes, and staged external density/language delivery across Milestones 13 and 17.
- **Hardening** — Made live workload canvases share application-owned mouse/two-finger pan with optional off-axis zoom, coordinated Dynamic Layout paragraph readiness into one atomic presentation, coalesced superseded slider layouts, retained workload resource reclamation, and moved comparison-module parsing off the first Off-axis click path.

- **Opaque canvas presentation** — Moved the design-token background and optional 16 CSS px grid into every live renderer as an opaque screen-space pass. The grid remains fixed across text transforms, pan, scale, and DPR, and grid-off skips the mesh instead of revealing a CSS layer. Increased the retained MTSDF hard-shadow offset so Paint & Effects exposes a legible displaced shadow against the in-canvas surface.
- **RAF telemetry presentation** — Kept React summary publication bounded while giving each graph canvas a stable ref to its preallocated ring and mutable cursor, allowing the path to repaint on RAF without application-tree updates or per-frame garbage. Restored wide-screen side-by-side startup/graph composition with three stacked graph rows and the compact three-column fallback.
- **Advanced-shaping playback** — Reduced the live timeline to Play/Pause, Reset, and scrub. The showcase loads playing from tick zero and loops at the authored boundary; seeking pauses until explicit resume, reset returns to the empty authored start, and the start-aligned paragraph measure is centered in both viewport axes.
- **Advanced-shaping typewriter** — Split the bounded conformance corpus from paragraph-scale live showcase text, reveal complete grapheme units one at a time into a start-aligned measure centered in both viewport axes, and preserve the measure width while the paragraph grows. Maintained unit and live GPU probes require long copy, wrapping, stable width, no interpolation, and no horizontal-origin drift while preserving the exact finite conformance matrix.
- **Advanced-shaping evidence** — Refreshed the authenticated Chromium 149 / Apple `metal-3` 1× WebGPU observation for the longer five-script corpus: 119.46–120.16 FPS, 0.2–0.3 ms median CPU submission, 0.679–3.457 ms median GPU time, 112–278 glyphs, and one to fifteen draws after each exact zero-missing-glyph state settled.
- **MTSDF scene evidence** — Refreshed the finite WebGL2 four-scene golden after the earlier geometric fill/outline correction intentionally changed effected pixels. The CI-style Chromium renderer produces `57e86b4b…a1e7`; GPU-friendly Chromium has a separate deterministic adapter result. Validation still gates resize, mip, transform, effects, glyph/draw counts, changed pixels, colors, and payload bytes.
- **MTSDF runtime size** — Refreshed the same-host isolated graph after the geometric effects correction: 352,285 raw, 263,631 minified, 77,439 gzip, and 60,106 Brotli bytes. The change is −220 raw / −42 minified / −2 gzip / +46 Brotli bytes and remains within the reviewed runtime budget.
- **Continuous benchmark presentation** — Kept live telemetry and the last complete canvas presentation visible through sliders and font-fixture changes. Font selection no longer changes the source corpus, remounts the whole benchmark surface, or hides missing coverage; the maintained product probe checks source-length equality, visible missing-glyph counts, stable canvas identity, and zero empty CPU-metric/loading transitions.
- **Telemetry graphs** — Expanded FPS, CPU-frame, and GPU-frame histories into full-width columns ordered by consumer importance, added allocation-free low/high watermarks from the existing rings, and assigned equal-intensity green, cyan, and orange design tokens so each series is immediately distinguishable.
- **Retained controls** — Confirmed the benchmark production graph uses the pinned React Compiler runtime, then removed a renderer-level source of flashing: non-layout controls no longer recreate and swap every `Text` object. Paint, animation, shadow, stroke, and inspection toggles now update the retained scene in place, with unit classification and a causal live paint-revision guard against batch reset.
- **Activity lifecycle** — Made Benchmark and Conformance named React 19.2 Activities with per-mode workload memory. Hidden Benchmark render/effect loops and advanced-shaping playback stop; hidden Conformance capture aborts. A causal live proof holds the hidden paint revision constant through a complete three-sample Conformance run and then resumes the preserved Paint & Effects workload.
- **Live workload inspection** — Expanded Paint & Effects into a paragraph-scale circular chromatic sequence on the retained `Text` object's paint-only batch path, with a corrected white MTSDF outer stroke, optional hard shadow, and causal evidence that animation does not trigger layout. Dynamic Layout now uses longer independently reflowing paragraphs and default-on neutral measure frames with a visible toggle. Documented a non-binding TSL effect-composition proposal whose admission requires ordered graph chaining, object-local uniforms, shared-material safety, semantic effect indices, dual-backend pixels, lifecycle proof, and a measured complete-workload win.
- **Range controls** — Replaced text-input padding and browser-default slider chrome with one shared range geometry: the visible rail begins and ends at the 14 px thumb's actual center travel, while an accent segment fills from the minimum through the controlled value. Added component coverage plus a live GPU product assertion for zero padding, explicit 7 px inset, visible fill/rail layers, and exact endpoint values.
- **Closure verification** — Passed the full package build/type/Rust/oracle/SIMD/integration/fuzz suite, all 88 benchmark units, all 16 isolated Chromium conformance scenarios, the packed consumer, lint, formatting, and OKF validation. The roadmap now records the committed raster performance baseline separately from the still-open final adversarial review.
- **Evidence index** — Refreshed the authenticated autoresearch index to the already-committed CJK universality result identity; the source evidence itself is unchanged, and the benchmark-wide stale-index gate now covers its current bytes.
- **MTSDF compute research** — Documented a measured-admission WebGPU compute generator follow-up: CPU topology and packing remain authoritative, scalar Wasm remains the offline fallback, and no second implementation ships without a material end-to-end win against the native oracle.
- **TSL boundary** — Moved every remaining Three.js node type to the public `three/webgpu` export, aligned the repository-local TSL skill, and made package/app lint reject legacy root, internal source, addons/examples, and bare R3F imports.
- **Workload lifecycle** — Keyed live renderer lifecycles by workload after the combined probe exposed a fast-navigation race: switching from Benchmark Ipsum to Advanced Shaping while the shared Inter surface was initializing could publish the previous 1,358-character configuration indefinitely. Each workload now initializes, measures, and disposes its own renderer surface.
- **Live-suite isolation** — Moved the advanced-shaping performance observation ahead of GPU-heavy interaction and conformance probes. The combined local lane now measures a fresh product surface before accumulated renderer work while retaining the same later control and correctness coverage.
- **Probe lifecycle** — Removed the mobile product probe's fixed-port child process. Its Vite server now selects an available local port and shares transactional cleanup with headed Chromium, so an occupied development port or browser-launch failure cannot strand the responsive evidence lane.
- **Evidence correction** — Refreshed authenticated Bitmap geometry after the composed Inter metadata frame correction: WebGPU and WebGL2 now agree on hashes `a47930d3…e893` and `95b20e05…a34d` with bounds `[68, 18, 313, 112]` and `[260, 82, 505, 176]`. The same correction adds 20 bytes to the complete Noto core GLB; a fresh portable bake records 1,540,480 raw, 654,597 gzip-9, and 515,676 Brotli-9 bytes without changing the retained 1,539,372-byte shaping payload or its exact CJK output.
- **Conformance** — Added the final cross-technique source-outline inspector: Bitmap and MSDF render through public `Text`, browser Canvas2D independently rasterizes the same pinned source font at the candidate's physical size and baselines, and synchronized candidate/reference/colorized-difference panels expose reviewed mean/over-tolerance envelopes with negative controls.
- **Performance** — Recorded an explicit 1× WebGPU Paint & Effects baseline that separates first-draw CPU submit, first GPU frame with atlas upload, steady CPU/GPU frames, FPS, font/GPU bytes, and exact isolated core/shaper/runtime/optional-baker sizes. Paint & Effects remains one workload with animated per-word hue, opacity slider, and an MSDF-only stroke slider that stays visibly disabled for Bitmap.
- **Hardening** — Completed the item-8.4 dual-backend MTSDF renderer and base-level scalar conformance oracle; added reviewed error envelopes and negative controls, causal Bitmap/MSDF workload probes, explicit dynamic-reflow timing, and the existing Paint & Effects workload's live per-word hue with opacity plus MSDF-only stroke.
- **Implementation** — Published six authenticated full-face Bitmap/MTSDF benchmark fixture families, exact NPOT mip-chain accounting, payload/page/GPU inspection, downloadable font notices, and streaming artifact identity tests; DotGothic16 and Amiri remain labeled stress fixtures pending paging.
- **CJK showcase fidelity** — Replaced DotGothic16 as the Advanced Shaping visual default with a deterministic HarfBuzz 13 subset of the authored Noto Sans CJK JP corpus. Matching one-page Bitmap and MTSDF artifacts keep shaping and raster glyph identity together, while the UI exposes all baked fonts and marks each case recommendation. DotGothic16 remains available as an explicitly pixel-styled stress fixture; complete CJK still belongs to chunked paging.
- **Vertical-writing research** — Scheduled a post-v1 Japanese vertical-writing milestone after complete CJK paging, with explicit OpenType vertical metrics/features, Unicode cluster orientation, right-to-left column geometry, interaction coordinates, shared-renderer gates, and a preserved horizontal fast path.
- **Hardening** — Enforced serial lazy module Workers for runtime raster bakers, bounded segmented Wasm artifact transfer, unsigned ABI normalization, asynchronous Worker preparation failures, registry subscription release, authenticated collection-face reuse, generator-only MTSDF host compatibility, and removal of obsolete packed ABI V0 output.
- **Benchmark payload terminology** — Renamed transferred font data as font assets and labeled atlas allocation as GPU texture memory. Per-page rows now distinguish download bytes from GPU bytes without implying that every resident texture is uncompressed.
- **MTSDF runtime and validator** — Closed roadmap item 8.3 with the optional fixed renderer and isolated strict validator. One dependency-light implementation now owns lossless KTX2 structure/data-format metadata and dense 20-byte record rules for bitmap and MTSDF runtime and standalone paths; Khronos/Ajv remain validator-only. Canonical Inter proves all ten pages in embedded and external forms, authenticated page identity, generated-mip residency, fill/outline/shadow batch updates, disposal, field-level mutations, and KTX2 DFD corruption without importing baker Wasm into rendering.

## 2026-07-26

- **MTSDF runtime foundation** — Began roadmap item 8.3 with the optional fixed runtime module over one instanced batch family and one version-matched TSL graph. Strict in-module decoding checks identity, constants, dense records, lossless RGBA8 KTX2, and bounded mip residency before resource publication. RGB median reconstruction supplies fill; the true-distance alpha channel supplies four-atlas-pixel-bounded outline and translated hard shadow. Bitmap and MTSDF now share atlas decoding, record validation, quad construction, and paint/layout invariants. Canonical Inter decodes all ten real pages and exercises batch creation, repaint, and disposal without runtime baker Wasm.
- **Fixed MTSDF baker** — Closed roadmap item 8.2 with one fixed descriptor and one artifact baker over the admitted scalar core. A shared Fontations provider removes the former admission/baker outline duplication, and one shared TypeScript direct-memory bridge now owns bitmap/MTSDF allocation, response framing, validation, copying, and cleanup. Canonical Inter produces exact 20-byte records and ten lossless linear RGBA8 KTX2 pages with byte-identical embedded/external content: 39,111,736 GPU bytes and 39,177,416 external serialized bytes. The standalone 44,109-byte zero-import kernel remains admission evidence rather than a duplicate published module; the full Worker-hosted baker declares its progress callback in the generated ABI.
- **Fixed MTSDF coordinates** — Added an explicit checked generator transform so the fixed baker can place every glyph on one global plane grid and encode one authoritative pixel range without per-glyph stretching. Oracle mode still uses the admitted one-em range and retains every exact native-oracle hash; the added production seam costs 164 raw Wasm bytes.
- **Shared lossless raster artifacts** — Began item 8.2 by extracting the canonical 20-byte glyph records, checked shelf atlas, lossless linear R8/RGBA8 KTX2 encoder, GLB framing, SHA-256 identities, and packaging enums into one `no_std + alloc` Rust support crate shared by bitmap and MTSDF bakers. Exact Inter bitmap records, pages, GLBs, and reports remain byte-identical. The bitmap baker grows by 8,749 raw / 1,735 Brotli bytes for the checked shared boundary; those bytes remain inside optional baker Wasm and never enter shaping or rendering bundles.
- **MTSDF generator admission closed** — Compared isolated scalar, compiler-auto-vectorized, and explicit-four-lane Wasm kernels through seven exact native-oracle identities, a Fontations-emitted 2,937-slot Inter corpus, alternating Node and GPU-enabled Chromium calls, instrumented warm allocation counts, steady-state memory growth, and raw/optimized/gzip/Brotli size. This initial pre-correction packet selected scalar as the one production artifact; the corrected-kernel identities, sizes, and workload split are superseded by the current 2026-07-29 closure entry. Edge-color corner storage now reuses generator scratch, and the explicit SIMD implementation stays test-only for reproducibility.
- **MTSDF package integration** — Promoted the scalar generator from an internal ABI proof into the `@pmndrs/glyph` production build: one Binaryen-optimized Wasm and its Rust-generated JSON contract ship as package resources behind a strict direct-memory TypeScript host. The admission kernel remains zero-import; the full artifact baker adds one contract-declared progress callback for observable Worker bakes. All seven native-msdfgen candidate hashes survive the host; malformed values and outlines, forged and stale allocation ownership, ABI drift, borrowed-result copying, and transactional cleanup are named regressions. Independent size evidence is maintained by the package-size lane. A hash-gated local Node 24 arm64 observation separates compile, initialization, cold-corpus, and warm execution costs; item 8.1 remains open only for the scalar/auto-vectorized/explicit-SIMD shipping decision.
- **Planning** — Scheduled post-v1 responsive editorial flow regions and a live mixed-raster composition: native-strike bitmap body copy, an MTSDF pull quote, and a Slug display treatment share one authoritative shaped and positioned layout around columns and explicit exclusions. The accompanying research distinguishes Pretext's proven dynamic obstacle wrapping from pmndrs/glyph's proposed exact complex-script GPU pipeline, treats performance as a phase-by-phase hypothesis, and defers a public API, contour-tight wrapping, and arbitrary rendered-pixel occlusion until integration evidence exists. Later roadmap reconciliation assigned this work to Milestone 12 and large-coverage CJK raster paging/icons to Milestone 14.
- **MTSDF direct-memory ABI** — Split host mechanics from geometry: `mtsdf-core` remains allocator-agnostic `no_std + alloc`, while `mtsdf-baker` owns `dlmalloc`, a Rust-generated JSON contract, and a checked C ABI over exact active allocations and borrowed RGBA8 results. The zero-import direct-memory integration test proves contract access, generation identity, release, and stale-pointer rejection. The complete Binaryen-optimized boundary is 44,368 bytes (17,930 gzip; 14,865 Brotli).

- **Owned MTSDF evidence** — Implemented the `no_std + alloc` Rust geometry core with typed outline errors, reusable scratch, AoS-to-SoA lowering, true signed line/curve distances, contour-aware overlap resolution, and nonzero-fill sign correction. All seven native-msdfgen oracle cases now have zero coverage mismatches and 0.472–0.549-byte mean alpha error. The optimized no-import admission module is 42,607 bytes (18,318 gzip; 15,333 Brotli); 2,915 Inter glyphs are cold/warm checksum-stable, and the 40.173-second scalar median establishes the optimization baseline. A deterministic 1,000-run cargo-fuzz smoke completes without a crash.

- **Repository-owned MTSDF core** — Concluded dependency admission in favor of a purpose-built `no_std + alloc` Rust generator under `packages/glyph/rust`. Added the primary Valve/Chlumský literature path, identified pinned native `msdfgen` as the canonical executable MTSDF reference, recorded Klyff, Rust bindings, OxiText, UIKit, and Zappar license/architecture findings, and made reusable scratch storage, data-oriented edge layout, scalar/SIMD equivalence, generated C ABI/JSON, and direct Wasm memory access explicit gates.

- **MTSDF oracle corpus** — Routed one Rust-owned shape command stream through the candidate and pinned native `msdfgen` with explicit pixel-center framing. Six ordinary, corner, overlap, curve, and counter cases have zero reconstruction mismatches outside the one-byte quantization band; empty and malformed providers return structured errors. The self-intersection negative case exposes the unresolved candidate blocker at 768/1,600 pixels and remains deliberately red in admission status while its freshness test stays deterministic and CI-safe.

- **MTSDF quality oracle** — Pinned Chlumsky `msdfgen` 1.13.0 by tag commit and source-archive SHA-256. A package-owned provisioner builds only the dependency-free native core and shape-description executable inside an ignored package cache; the oracle remains outside package files, browser dependencies, ordinary builds, and platform releases.

- **MTSDF candidate size** — Added a non-shipping package-owned admission harness for exact `klyff_msdf` 0.1.3 with default features disabled. The locked graph contains no WGPU or duplicate font parser; `wasm32-unknown-unknown` imports nothing; and a fixed 40×40 synthetic MTSDF returns FNV-1a `1627af29` after correcting its outer-contour winding to the TrueType convention. Reproducible Rust 1.97.1 plus Binaryen 129 records 81,308 raw, 72,510 optimized, 32,161 gzip, and 27,829 Brotli bytes. A blocker-sensor test still proves the published invalid-threshold API panics, so viable size does not admit the dependency.

- **MTSDF generator admission** — Began roadmap item 8.1 by auditing current generator candidates before adding a dependency. Pure-Rust `klyff_msdf` 0.1.3 is the leading patch candidate, but its published core is not `no_std`, defaults to a second older Skrifa, exposes panic/assert paths, builds an unconditional per-outline diagnostic string, and documents quadratic flattening during intersecting-shape cleanup. Native Chlumsky `msdfgen` remains the test-only quality oracle. Milestone 8 now requires upstreamable hardening, Wasm/size evidence, deterministic oracle comparison, malformed-input coverage, and cargo-fuzz admission before item 8.2.

- **Advanced-shaping performance** — Closed roadmap item 7.2 with a performance observation that is separate from finite conformance duration. The human WebGPU surface ran every exact authored lane at explicit 1× DPR and waited for twelve causal FPS/GPU reports without sleeps. Chromium 149 on Apple `metal-3` observed 119.7–120.9 FPS, 0.1–0.2 ms median CPU submit, 0.050–0.149 ms median GPU time, 8.6–18.5 ms initial public `Text` readiness, and 23.4–119.0 ms startup; the record labels its environment and remains evidence rather than a portability threshold. Live and captured reports now present the rolling GPU median instead of hard-coding it unavailable.

- **Advanced-shaping conformance** — Derived all 68 finite timeline frames from the same five-lane product corpus and executed them through the public `Text` bitmap path in the shared Chromium runner. The authenticated record fixes 709 laid-out glyphs, 625 rendered instances, 72 draws, zero missing glyphs, 17,362 normalized bytes, and hash `51ba1d14`, with wrong-hash and missing-glyph negative controls. Its observed duration remains explicitly classified as conformance execution rather than live renderer performance; a separate environment-labeled performance observation is the last item-7.2 gate.

- **Advanced-shaping motion** — Completed roadmap item 7.2's live presentation seam without changing authoritative shaping or layout. The optional bitmap subpath snapshots copied glyph identities/origins and interpolates only stable matched positions; topology changes stay at their committed target, origin storage is lazy, updates are allocation-free, and the existing TSL graph retains final physical-pixel snapping. The product animates authored width changes without per-frame React state, exposes causal presentation evidence, and its GPU Vitexec probe proves playback plus matched transitions before pausing.

- **Advanced-shaping live path** — Bound the five-lane corpus to the retained public `Text` renderer with visible edit, play/pause, step, reset, and scrub controls plus authored width reflow. Preview updates return their committed layout and publish the exact settled timeline tick/text length only after `Text.ready`. The hardware-GPU Vitexec product probe now crosses WebGPU → forced WebGL2 → WebGPU timing, renders every authenticated fixture with zero missing glyphs, steps each lane, and edits/restores Latin without sleeps or retries. Continuous width and glyph-position interpolation remains open rather than being inferred from these discrete authoritative transitions.

- **Advanced-shaping fixtures** — Began roadmap item 7.2 with one immutable five-lane timeline for Latin features/marks, Arabic joining, Indic reordering, mixed bidi, and CJK line breaking. Exact integer seek/step/playback state and authored reveal units keep tests causal and avoid splitting combining or complex-script units. Added hash-pinned static Noto Sans Devanagari and bounded DotGothic16 Japanese fixtures without weakening variable-font rejection or pretending to solve pan-CJK paging. Fresh public Node/package-owned bitmap bakes must reproduce the checked-in Amiri, Devanagari, and Japanese 16 ppem GLBs byte-for-byte; these benchmark fixtures do not enter browser-core or runtime-shaper payloads.

- **Bake-host baseline** — Closed roadmap item 7.1 after recording three isolated offline and browser-Worker cold/warm Inter bakes with complete byte parity. Offline cold initialization plus first bake measured a 4.16 ms median and warm same-instance bake 2.94 ms; a fresh Chromium 149 context plus Worker/Wasm first bake measured 21.70 ms and the second job queued on that reused Worker 3.50 ms. Every path returned the exact 172,140-byte canonical artifact. The autoresearch baseline now authenticates this report, but the observations are not portability thresholds; item 7.2 is active.

- **Packed consumer** — Closed the remaining package-execution gap by excluding `.tsbuildinfo` from the tarball, checking the installed CLI's executable mode and help path, and installing both package tarballs into an isolated Vite application. Chromium now runs the installed runtime-bake module Worker and returns canonical Inter's exact 172,140 bytes and SHA-256 `296f23ff52aa50bdec3662b1037cd3648be814de089e122e828f88bd8f29c4f8`; source-workspace resolution can no longer mask a broken published Worker graph.

- **Extension schemas** — Compiled all four canonical Draft-04 extension schemas with their shared resource references in the ordinary package suite. Positive and mutation specimens closed two pre-implementation holes: MTSDF pages are now restricted to lossless linear RGBA8, and Slug curve pages to lossless linear RGBA16F, matching the accepted raster contracts. Core and bitmap retain their complete generated-artifact validators; the MTSDF and Slug checks establish executable contracts without claiming those rasters are implemented.

- **Governance baseline** — Added four linked ADRs that preserve the decision register as the sole status ledger while recording accepted package/runtime, shaping/identity, raster/container, and verification/optimization rationale. Activated the autoresearch protocol in a fail-closed state: a versioned schema, exact TypeScript validator, deterministic generator, and baseline rooted at `0e9610aaca9777156fa81fcc3659d4e31603f555` authenticate package-size, admission, shaping, paragraph, bidi, CJK, and toolchain evidence. Campaigns remain explicitly disabled and ordinary tests prove they cannot cross the guard accidentally.

- **Milestone 7.1 hardening** — Began the integration-hardening gate with an actual asynchronous lifecycle correction: raster decodes that finish after runtime disposal are now released exactly once and reject their waiters instead of publishing a dead resource. Deterministic tests cover stale raster generations, same-artifact font re-registration, stale shaping handles, and plan ownership. Consumer-bundler module inspection now proves the runtime baker remains dynamic and heavy optional graphs stay outside browser core; a real packed tarball resolves every ESM/resource export, preserves the module-Worker declaration, and rejects CommonJS. The browser-core change adds 204 minified bytes and 30 Brotli bytes on the canonical host.

- **R3F v10 integration pin** — Replaced the provisional React Three Fiber 9.6.1 lane with the agreed 10.0.0-alpha.2 release and switched repository imports to its `/webgpu` subpath. Its published peers already accept React 19.2 and Three.js 0.185.1, but the WebGPU entry eagerly imports Three's browser-only Inspector and therefore fails during Node module evaluation. A narrow patch stops auto-extending that optional Inspector; a second patch retargets the 9.1.0 test renderer's static Three/R3F imports to the WebGPU entry. Upstream should make Inspector registration lazy and publish a v10-aware WebGPU test-renderer entry. The deterministic Node harness supplies and restores only the animation globals required by `frameloop: 'never'`; browser compatibility remains owned by the real `WebGPURenderer` root and Suspense probes.

- **Responsive spacing** — Corrected the form-control font reset that silently overrode every explicit Tailwind text size, restoring 10–12 px button and field labels with unclipped 28 px-or-taller controls. The desktop three-column shell now begins only when its rail, scene, and controls fit at 1,200 px; 1,024 px uses the full-width bottom-navigation flow. Narrow scene headers stack their chips, startup cards use two columns, and live-state labels keep reserved breathing room. The maintained browser probe now rejects horizontal overflow, oversized or clipped control labels, crowded control heights, and incorrect tablet/desktop navigation at 390, 1,024, and 1,280 CSS pixels.

- **GPU timing** — Closed the remaining item-6.4 implementation gap with Three.js's public timestamp-query path: the live `WebGPURenderer` requests adapter timestamps on WebGPU and disjoint timer queries in forced WebGL2, resolves at the reporting cadence on the next animation callback, and stores genuine GPU milliseconds in the existing fixed typed-array ring. Query teardown is transactional: a closing preview stops publishing and scheduling, allows the one active query to drain, then stops and disposes the renderer. The causal Vitexec surface now proves WebGPU → WebGL2 → WebGPU replacement with a real timing sample from every supported backend and no timer cushions, device loss, or console errors.

- **Live benchmark telemetry** — Replaced growing CPU/FPS arrays, element shifting, copied sort inputs, and SVG point-string construction with fixed 120-sample `Float32Array` rings, one preallocated quantile scratch buffer, and allocation-free canvas sparkline painting. Added the reserved GPU history graph without substituting CPU time for unavailable timestamp queries. The bitmap benchmark now measures fixture and atlas bytes from the loaded artifact contract, captures environment metadata and immutable history snapshots only on demand, exposes rendered device size and proportional paragraph width, and drives viewport changes through retained `Text` reflow. Benchmark ipsum now uses positive workload copy and renders an executable 1,150-glyph Inter contract; candidate/reference/difference language remains confined to conformance.

- **Milestone 6.4 product correction** — Reopened the benchmark application before Milestone 6 closure. The human default is a continuously rendered benchmark control plane organized by mode, technique, backend, and workload, with live consumer-cost, startup, retained-size, CPU/FPS, and supported GPU-time evidence. Conformance is a separate finite deep-inspection surface for candidate/reference/difference visuals, structured evidence, and explicitly labeled end-to-end test duration. Reclassified Bitmap Text Frame as conformance and Text Ladder, Off-axis / 3D, Dynamic Layout, and Paragraph Stress as live workloads. Split benchmark ipsum into a small diagnostic specimen and a paragraph-scale live workload. The Figma mockup remains visual/token input rather than an information-architecture contract.
- **Paragraph Stress volume correction** — Classified its text-volume control as a corpus topology change so dragging the slider immediately rebuilds the repeated paragraph set. Retained animation and paint controls continue to avoid replacement layout work.
- **Dynamic Layout first-frame continuity** — Replaced the uniform-width staging layout with the same phase-offset width function and elapsed clock used by live animation. All three initial layouts still settle before one atomic scene publication, eliminating the immediate content-shift flash.
- **Sharp telemetry graphs** — Sized each sparkline backing store from its fractional CSS bounds and display density, then drew with the exact effective backing-store transform. Fractional grid columns and display-density changes no longer cause browser resampling blur.

- **Benchmark correction** — Moved the measurement-boundary correction into active item 6.4 after the first bitmap capture exposed the mistake. The app now defaults to Benchmark and exposes a separate Conformance mode with independent technique, WebGPU/WebGL2 backend, and workload controls. Conformance visibly presents reference, candidate, difference, structured results, and validation statistics; its readback, CPU composition, comparison, clipping, and hashing remain test costs. Benchmark mode reports renderer initialization, font fetch/registration, public `Text` readiness, first draw, total startup, artifact/GPU bytes, warm CPU frame submit, FPS, and rolling CPU/FPS histories over a live oracle-free loop. Real WebGPU/WebGL2 timestamp queries remain the item-6.4 follow-up; unsupported GPU timing is visibly unavailable.

- **Milestone 6 adversarial remediation** — Resolved the first Opus review findings without closing the two review checkboxes: committed generations release superseded font-disposal listeners, text edits revalidate feature ranges, empty global features become no-ops, reused paragraphs observe cancellation, semantic React prop equality avoids no-op glyph uploads, bitmap rejects unsupported effects, and package-wide lint/format gates replace hand-listed coverage. The shared bitmap registry now renders through public `Text` with exact full/resized-clipped CPU/GPU oracles. The registered React target replaced the app-level test renderer and leaked global act flag with a real R3F root backed by `WebGPURenderer`, pinned natural/narrow paragraph oracles, retained public `Text` identity, and a real draw submission. Browser-core size measurement externalizes declared peers instead of raising its budget around Three.js. Canonical documentation now marks Milestone 6 active pending closure review, assigns the React/R3F decision a unique ID, uses only the register's declared decision statuses, lists the actual headless conformance cases, and describes the benchmark-ipsum ligature lane as candidates rather than claiming an unproved substitution.

- **Bitmap correctness** — Corrected the native strike contract after visual inspection exposed distorted thin stems: the baker now records Zeno's integer mask placement in strike-pixel units instead of mapping final texels back onto analytic outline bounds, and the shared TSL vertex graph snaps projected edges to physical framebuffer pixels. A Rust invariant proves native plane/atlas dimensions match, while a benchmark-only CPU compositor matches every normalized WebGPU/WebGL2 byte at 1× and 2× despite a deliberately fractional unsnapped origin. Both backends now share complete hashes per DPR and 3,473 half-coverage pixels. The optimized bitmap baker shrank from 657,942 to 612,472 bytes after removing the unused unscaled metrics path. A package-owned one-line `@types/three` patch fixes the `modelViewProjection` `vec4` contract; scalar TSL construction keeps TypeScript 7 checks below one second. Hinted grayscale and optional four-phase RGBA/R8 packing are documented research, and LCD/ClearType rendering is explicitly out of scope.
- **Implementation** — Implemented roadmap items 6.2 and 6.3 pending their Milestone 6 adversarial review. The framework-neutral Three.js `Text` group validates state atomically, resolves multi-font shaping and raster resources through registry-scoped caches, retains the last complete generation during asynchronous replacement, rejects stale publication, distinguishes paint/reflow/reshape updates, and owns deterministic disposal. The React 19 subpath flattens nested attributed text, suspends on shared font/raster/shaper dependencies, reconciles one retained core object through React Three Fiber, forwards that object through refs, and handles Strict Mode cleanup without timers. Resolved R3F behavior is covered through test renderer 9.1.0; a causally gated browser Vitexec probe proves pending Suspense because the upstream test renderer loops on uncached suspended promises.
- **Correction** — Made bitmap density explicit in the live and captured rendering contracts: a 16 px strike renders at 16 device pixels, so 2× DPR uses an 8 CSS px layout rather than silently magnifying the atlas. The selected strike now travels with the draw batch; metrics report baked ppem, rendered ppem, CSS size, and scale ratio. The live canvas fills the available runner area, stays transparent over the design-token grid, and leaves the header and captured-result row content-sized. Replaced placeholder copy with the five-lane benchmark ipsum covering Latin rhythm, numerals, kerning, punctuation, ligatures, and common mathematics; Inter coverage and the 120 visible-glyph draw are executable gates.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 6.1 with the first real bitmap font frame and explicit density control. The canonical 927,148-byte Inter GLB travels through registry loading, HarfRust layout, strict R8 KTX2/record decode, 695,296-byte texture upload, one order-preserving instanced batch, and one shared TSL graph. The existing app buttons now select real 1×/2× renderer density while automated runs declare it. WebGPU and forced WebGL2 agree on exact half-coverage ink geometry at both densities after their opposite readback row origins are normalized; framebuffer bytes scale from 122,880 to 491,520 and total tracked GPU bytes from 818,176 to 1,186,816. Transactional decode releases earlier textures on any later failure, and external page residency remains deferred to Milestone 13. Item 6.2 is active.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 6.0 on the repository's Three.js 0.185.1, `@types/three` 0.185.1, and TypeScript 7.0.2 pins. Follow-up measurement replaced the provisional exact-signature adapter with direct public `three/tsl` arithmetic calls: clean package and benchmark graph checks complete in 0.18 and 0.17 seconds without casts or a dependency patch, while the method-chain form remains the measured declaration-expansion hazard. The same `WebGPURenderer`/TSL graph produces exact hash `fec0f57de0b19bc7dacb5b0fc3de7b56fc68dfdbeeebc8f9f4c506bf6e821c77` across three measured runs on an asserted WebGPU backend and forced WebGL2 fallback; a deterministic oracle and wrong-pixel negative control also expose and normalize Three.js's 256-byte-aligned WebGPU readback rows. The synthetic shader is not claimed as a rendered font frame; item 6.1 is active.
- **Tooling** — Started the stacked Milestones 6–8 branch with a repository-local TSL skill adapted from `three-flatland` commit `2935a89fcd9999e8a8b3d3b733f7f7302285cd60`. The lean progressive references route material, compute, post-processing, migration, typing, and live-GPU verification work to installed Three.js source rather than remembered APIs. Exact TypeScript 7.0.2 and `@types/three` 0.185.1 fixtures exposed a pre-render declaration-performance boundary: imports and typed constant attachment finish in under one second, while one ordinary TSL operator exceeded 60 seconds. Active roadmap item 6.0 now requires a measured type strategy and real WebGPU/WebGL2 shader proof without broad type erasure before bitmap rendering begins.
- **CI** — Added the required pull-request and `main` workflow over the canonical `pnpm check` gate using immutable current-release action SHAs, mise-owned toolchain pins, the fropresentation dependency graph, and package-owned headless Chromium provisioning. The root typecheck builds workspace exports first so the same gate is valid in a fresh checkout rather than inheriting local `dist` state. Rust release builds remap workspace and Cargo registry paths before optimization, removing checkout-specific strings. macOS arm64 and Ubuntu x64 evidence then proved that the pinned native Rust/Binaryen and Rolldown toolchains can encode equivalent Wasm/JavaScript outputs with small host-specific byte differences while preserving ABI and exact baked products. Goldens therefore authenticate source and every product byte; canonical release-builder hashes remain release provenance rather than a cross-architecture test oracle. The size report names its measurement host, stays exact on that host, and checks every foreign-host entry against the same complete reviewed raw/minified/gzip/Brotli budget table used by Vitest. The eight deterministic browser cases share one bounded Chromium/Vite conformance session with an isolated page and named lifecycle deadline per case, avoiding repeated cold starts and silent process stalls. OKF package digests exclude package-local `.cache` directories so provisioned tools and Vite state cannot masquerade as source drift. Failure-only CI evidence is retained for seven days. Vitexec, hardware-GPU evidence, performance thresholds, and coverage-guided nightly fuzzing remain explicit non-CI lanes.

## 2026-07-25

- **Cleanup** — Removed the unread registered-font artifact wrapper; validated shaping and raster subviews already retain the owned backing buffer required by their lifetimes.
- **Fuzzing** — Seeded raw shaper request mutations with real Inter data from the baker and validator, proving both base requests and surviving mutations enter HarfRust instead of every case stopping at a missing-font status.
- **Correction** — Kept the Cargo-derived bitmap generator label a compile-time concatenation, preserving the optimized Wasm size and canonical bitmap golden without runtime formatting code.
- **Performance** — Decode both baker responses in-place while their Wasm allocations are live, copying only artifact ranges that survive release. This removes one full-result copy from the portable and bitmap paths while preserving owned public bytes and unconditional cleanup.
- **Size enforcement** — Added a non-writing package-size freshness gate to the ordinary benchmark test lane and narrowly raised the portable bridge ceiling after central version authority added 74 minified bytes.
- **Tooling** — Made the benchmark app's zero-warning oxlint and oxfmt checks mandatory in the root `pnpm check` lane, keeping local and CI enforcement aligned.
- **Version authority** — Added a contract-only portable-baker subpath so loader, validator, and bridge share baker/format versions without a heavy browser edge; Rust shaper and bitmap-generator versions now derive from Cargo metadata, and the canonical version contract lists the bitmap ABI plus exact Fontations/Skrifa/bidi pins.
- **Test reliability** — Replaced Playwright network-idle heuristics with causal app readiness, validated admission-process failures and parsed lifecycle records before publication, made exact contract comparisons non-coercive, and deferred export URL release to the next microtask without timers.
- **Performance** — Removed quadratic paragraph-layout scans with one-time cluster prefix indexes, a monotonic style cursor, and direction-aware binary bounds over HarfRust's monotone clusters. An 80,000-glyph justified-layout stress pass dropped from a 431 ms to 268 ms median in the same five-sample local Node run; the browser core cost is 1,140 minified / 240 Brotli bytes.
- **Memory hardening** — Bounded every paragraph-derived cache to its 32 most recently used variants and each font's HarfRust cache to 64 plans. Hot calls retain identity and reuse, adversarial constraint/language variation has fixed retention, and the optimized shaper cost is 352 raw bytes.
- **Filesystem safety** — Detect output aliases by device/inode before reading or baking, reject directories and other non-regular targets with structured errors, and narrow raster plugins through property-proving `in` checks instead of a cast.
- **Correctness** — Stopped treating a standalone OpenType `STAT` table as proof of a variable font. Static fonts carrying style attributes now bake normally; actual axis/delta tables remain rejected and named regressions prove both branches.
- **Benchmark correctness** — Passed real sample indexes to targets, rejected invalid run counts before loading, removed the unreachable failed-summary state, and made every successful result self-describing with `schemaVersion` and `controls`; Chromium verifies the emitted envelope and stable synthetic output.
- **Worker lifecycle** — Replaced implicit concurrent posts with one explicit FIFO bake, job-local queued cancellation, active-cancellation Worker replacement, and entry-side serialization. Two authenticated live Chromium observations show that sharing one initialized Worker within a three-font burst also beats three sequential Worker initializations, while a multi-Worker pool remains evidence-gated.
- **Correctness** — Removed trailing mandatory-break clusters before ellipsis insertion, preventing a truncated line from extending its visible range across the newline into hidden text.
- **Hardening** — Made shaper result layout and arena publication fallible and pre-sized; allocation exhaustion now returns the existing `RESULT_TOO_LARGE` status instead of trapping after successful shaping, for 664 additional raw Wasm bytes.
- **Security** — Required SHA-256 authentication for every URI-addressed external raster in the public type, Draft-04 schema, validator, and loader; resolver-only delivery remains available without inventing a URL.
- **Correctness** — Rejected project-wide font output collisions before baking, made execution phases mutually exclusive so validation is not double-counted as raster work, and made the default bitmap Wasm loader retry after failed initialization.
- **Hardening** — Scoped bitmap companion/page filenames by both shaping and raster identity, rejected ppem values beyond the padded 1024-pixel atlas range, and streamed glyph masks directly into bounded pages. Two fonts can no longer overwrite one another merely because they share bitmap settings, and the optimized Wasm grows only 639 raw bytes while removing the full-face intermediate bitmap set.
- **Hardening** — Kept malformed non-ASCII SFNT table tags inside the font validator's structured issue contract by comparing the closed four-byte tag vocabulary directly; a named regression covers the previously escaping UTF-8 decoder error.
- **Research** — Added a non-binding shaping-compilation concept covering the closed-corpus limit of static baking; total-portfolio break-even for semantic bytecode; an MLIR-based multi-target compiler direction; CPU/Wasm-first validation; WebGPU batching and CPU-readback constraints; and exact conformance, size, latency, memory, robustness, and maintenance gates.
- **Governance** — Established one canonical engineering house style for Rust, TypeScript, React, Wasm boundaries, lifecycle ownership, deterministic testing, comments, and documentation. A lean root agent guide routes to that OKF concept; the maintainability skill now owns only the review procedure, avoiding repeated context while keeping deliberate review available on demand.
- **Hardening** — Closed partial-acquisition cleanup gaps in both direct-memory baker bridges and the benchmark lifecycle, replaced cast-shaped Wasm/ABI trust with exact validation, narrowed the runtime Worker predicate to the shape it proves, and retained typed WebGPU availability through presentation.
- **Performance** — Accepted a measured 0.61 KiB Brotli increase in the lazy runtime-baker Worker for one-time ABI/result validation and allocation rollback, raised only its reviewed lazy-boundary ceilings, and kept the initial browser graph, Wasm artifacts, and shaping/layout/rendering loops unchanged.
- **Correction** — Recast the portable baker page as package-owned implementation evidence, removed its duplicate program-wide milestone ledger, retired stale compile-time-only package wording, and made checked arithmetic a normative obligation instead of overstating current allocation coverage.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 5.4 and Milestone 5 with authenticated Noto Sans CJK JP Regular 2.004 at the 65,535-glyph boundary; exact thirteen-case source/reduced HarfRust and HarfBuzz 13 equality; contextual CJK Script_Extensions; strict preserved language tags; supplementary Han, SVS, IVS, no-space and punctuation-safe paragraph contracts; deterministic malformed/fuzz coverage; and matching Node, Chromium 149, GPU-enabled Vitexec, and mobile Playwright evidence. Source `BASE`, `VORG`, `vhea`, and `vmtx` now survive baking without enabling vertical layout. Milestone 6 is next.
- **Verification** — Added a hash-authenticated HarfBuzz 13.0.0 source provisioner, Fontations-owned CJK fixture inspector, semantic freshness checks for the generated twelve-layout contract, a committed real-browser result, and exact payload evidence: 16,467,736 source bytes, 1,539,372 retained shaping bytes, 1,540,460 artifact bytes, and 654,925/514,547 gzip/Brotli shaping transport bytes.
- **Hardening** — Removed the duplicate 434,045-byte font-baker Wasm from `@pmndrs/glyph`; the portable baker package now solely owns the optimized artifact and canonical URL used by Node and the runtime Worker. Dependency-light shared functions now own V0 descriptors, sole-core-artifact checks, retryable successful initialization, and exact transferable byte ranges, with offline/Worker byte parity and reviewed runtime size ceilings.
- **Correction** — Tightened raster plugin descriptors to `JsonValue` without trusting TypeScript at the JavaScript boundary, retained deep RFC 8785 input validation, and resolved each descriptor/`rasterKey` pair once so project ordering, packaging, and baking cannot observe different values from a stateful plugin.
- **Planning** — Reopened Milestone 5 with active item 5.4 as a pre-render CJK universality gate: one pinned pan-CJK face must pass exact source/reduced HarfRust shaping, independent HarfBuzz comparison, horizontal paragraph layout, malformed/fuzz coverage, and deterministic Node/Chromium/Vitexec evidence. Milestone 6 remains the first bitmap rendering proof; raster paging and icon coverage remain Milestone 13, while fallback and vertical layout stay deferred.
- **Verification** — Kept the committed Vitexec probe browser-portable by loading value modules from Vite-root paths; the maintainer-local GPU lane passes the synthetic UI, exact paragraph measurement, positioned layout, bidi/policy/current-uikit hashes, and 390×844 mobile export flow without timers or retries.
- **Hardening** — Completed a milestone-by-milestone maintainability pass without public API changes: direct-memory Wasm allocations now retain module ownership and reject forged ranges; discovery is lexically deterministic; multi-artifact publication rolls back ordinary failures; Worker/source provenance lifecycles are explicit; paragraph preparation uses active-value and interval sweeps; trust-boundary TypeScript validators narrow honestly while normalized hot paths avoid repeated schema walks; plugin-produced JSON identities reject exotic prototypes, cycles, and excessive nesting during canonicalization; and shared benchmark digest logic derives policy hashes from actual layouts.
- **Governance** — Added the repository-local `maintainability-review` skill with a two-phase parallel audit/implementation workflow, Jane Street-inspired Rust/TypeScript rubric, trust-boundary validation policy, evidence requirements, full verification ladder, OKF maintenance, and atomic conventional-commit guidance.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 5.3 and Milestone 5 with Unicode 17 UAX #9 conformance, style/script/bidi run intersection, line-specific L1/L2 ordering, exact alignment/clipping/max-lines/ellipsis policies, a current-uikit-shaped measurement/layout fixture, fixed-seed paragraph-policy fuzzing, and deterministic Chromium plus WebGPU Vitexec execution. The exact Amiri source → bake → validated GLB → extracted reduced SFNT → HarfRust chain and independent HarfBuzz 13 oracle bind complex-script glyph IDs, UTF-16 clusters, positions, offsets, and flags rather than comparing summaries.
- **Verification** — Added immutable Amiri Regular 1.002 font/metadata/license fixtures, exact HarfRust and pinned HarfBuzz 13 Arabic/Latin oracles, and a mandatory source-font → portable bake → validated GLB → extracted reduced SFNT → HarfRust equality test covering joining, marks, lam-alef forms, Arabic numbers, and Latin without environment-dependent skips.
- **Implementation** — Added item 5.3's Unicode 17 bidi foundation: `unicode-bidi` 0.3.18 under `no_std + alloc` with its older bundled data disabled, generated `Bidi_Class` and normalized paired-bracket tables from pinned Unicode 17 inputs, a Rust-generated direct-memory UTF-16 ABI, all 770,241 direction-expanded generic UAX #9 cases plus all 91,707 character-specific cases, and focused Wasm supplementary-plane/direction tests. Paragraph bidi shaping/reordering and the remaining 5.3 policies stay explicitly open.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 5.2 with cached on-demand paragraph-owned SoA layout, exact natural/wide/narrow GLB-to-HarfRust position goldens, one-call batched boundary reshaping, height-only and full-layout cache evidence, normalized portable hashes with live handles checked separately, a recorded Chromium positioned-layout scenario, and sequential GPU Vitexec measurement/layout probes; item 5.3 policy and bidi work is active.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 5.1 with generated Unicode 17 Script/Script_Extensions tables, complete official UAX #14/#29 corpora, grapheme-safe span/script analysis, one copied broad HarfRust shape, measured clusters, greedy wrapping, allocation-light axis measurement, explicit baselines, exact Inter natural/wide/narrow GLB-path goldens, an independent Unicode size lane, recorded Chromium prepare-once/zero-Wasm-reflow evidence, and a GPU Vitexec paragraph probe; item 5.2 positioned layout is active.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap items 4.1–4.2 and Milestone 4 with HarfRust data/plan caching, Rust-generated batch/reshape/result offsets, direct TypeScript packing and borrowed SoA views, exact flags/positions/UTF-16 clusters across every pinned source → GLB → validator → registry → Wasm case, multi-run and reshape fixtures, extents/surrogate/lifecycle tests, deterministic raw-request fuzzing, independent full-module size reporting, and a recorded real Chromium 97-glyph/one-call conformance scenario; item 5.1 paragraph analysis and measurement is active.
- **Implementation** — Added the item-4.1 HarfRust registration foundation as a package-owned Rust 1.97.1 `no_std + alloc` Wasm module with a Rust-generated direct-memory ABI; the TypeScript bridge imports only validated GLB-retained shaping views, canonical Inter proves exact 171,056-byte scoped/idempotent retention and disposal, ordinary package tests include the new Rust crate, and independent size lanes report the 91,382-byte optimized Wasm separately from its JavaScript bridge. Item 4.1 remains active until shape-plan reuse/disposal is executable.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 3.3 and Milestone 3 with reference-counted shared-load cancellation, underlying fetch/stream/Worker abort, immediate idle-Worker termination/recovery, real Chromium Worker-versus-canonical-Node artifact hashing, a public loader-fallback benchmark target/scenario, and static/dynamic package-graph evidence; the browser gate exposed and fixed native `fetch` receiver loss that Node tolerated, and item 4.1 HarfRust registration is active.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 3.2 with a cached dynamically imported runtime host, named module Worker, versioned transfer protocol, provenance-preserving source copy, transferred authoritative result, exact portable baker wrapper/Wasm reuse, canonical Inter host/Worker/default-loader integration, static import-graph checks, and independent host/Worker/Wasm size lanes; item 3.3 browser parity and cancellation is active.
- **Hardening** — Kept the item-3.1 pinned Khronos/Ajv validator behind a cached dynamic import and corrected the package-size lane to separate static entry closures from dynamic chunks; the measured initial browser graph is 21,257 minified bytes and the lazy validator is reported independently at 584,061 bytes.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 3.1 with canonical baked-sibling probing, full untrusted GLB validation, request/shaping identity deduplication, registry-scoped lifecycle handles, exact retained SFNT/extents/provenance views, package-neutral embedded/external raster registration, relative companion loading and hash authentication, structured missing/invalid/incompatible behavior, streaming resource limits, and deterministic loader mutation fuzzing; item 3.2 Worker fallback is active.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 2.4 and Milestone 2 with the public typed `@pmndrs/glyph/bake` API, thin native-ESM CLI, canonical discovery reuse, selected package-baker imports, deterministic source grouping and mixed raster packaging, safe atomic filesystem publication, cancellation, and complete timing/memory/output/raw/gzip/Brotli reports; item 3.1 baked probing and registration is now active.
- **Hardening** — Fixed Node `Buffer` validation mutating the embedded SFNT `head.checksumAdjustment` through Buffer's aliasing `slice`; the validator now makes an explicit typed-array copy, and repeat-validation plus Node-host readback regressions prove byte purity.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 2.3 with an authenticated generic core/raster composer, opaque buffer-view rebasing across multiple extension types, embedded/external/page packaging, open-extension Khronos admission, exact combined/empty Inter goldens, and core-plus-bitmap validator round trips; item 2.4 Node API/CLI work is now active.
- **Implementation** — Added the package-owned portable bitmap artifact core: Fontations/Skrifa outline extraction, Zeno grayscale rasterization, deterministic atlas packing, dense 20-byte records, lossless R8 KTX2, embedded/external pages, generated direct-memory ABI, Binaryen optimization, layered schema/Khronos/KTX2/semantic validation of every declared variant, exact canonical Inter source/artifact/report/record/page goldens, a validated 65,535-glyph boundary, and deterministic Rust-input plus artifact-mutation fuzz smoke.
- **Implementation** — Added the browser-safe package-owned bitmap identity boundary: strict static-strike runtime validation, canonical ascending descriptors stamped with generator `0.0.0`, RFC 8785 serialization, SHA-256 raster-key derivation, public ESM subpath/type fixtures, and independent hash-oracle tests; artifact emission remains open under item 2.3.

## 2026-07-24

- **Verification** — Added deterministic fixed-seed Rust bake and TypeScript artifact-validation fuzz smoke, longer stable-toolchain mutation lanes, and an isolated mise-owned cargo-fuzz/libFuzzer workspace with exact dated-nightly and dependency pins; minimized crashes must become checked-in stable regressions.
- **Implementation** — Added the import-isolated core font validator with strict GLB parsing, exact pinned Khronos-report admission, Ajv Draft-04 schema evaluation against the offline Khronos revision, semantic/SFNT/extents/hash checks, exhaustive required-field/union mutations, and canonical Inter round-trip validation; removed the superseded test-only GLB inspector.
- **Hardening** — Isolated every TypeScript 7 unstable import and project/symbol-handle operation behind an exact-version compiler adapter; added a source-boundary sentinel and a plain-JavaScript discovery fixture so typed and untyped module support is executable rather than assumed.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 2.2 on the exact host-independent request/result boundary; added source/container/table/face-selection fixtures, exact Inter 4.1 reduced-SFNT identities and semantic checks, full-corpus HarfRust source/reduced equivalence, and pinned Binaryen 129.0.0 `-Oz` with zero-import and artifact-equivalence gates.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 2.1 with TypeScript 7 AST/symbol discovery for composed and raw core/React font declarations, immutable raster extraction, conservative canonical asset-root mapping, and exact-package ESM baker resolution; seven package/integration cases cover the declared positive and negative fixture inventory without exposing the partial Node API.
- **Verification** — Closed roadmap item 1.3 and Milestone 1 after 100 zero-retry deterministic UI executions across 10 fresh GPU-friendly Chromium/Vite lifecycles; every lifecycle reported 10 unique causal completions and WebGPU availability, both negative controls failed as required, and the evidence explicitly makes no pre-renderer GPU-workload claim.
- **Implementation** — Added executable milestone-1 source contracts for bitmap strikes, paragraph layout, GLB, malformed input, and GPU readback; proved the 65,535-glyph dense multi-page record boundary and empty multi-font/multi-raster identity; added causal UI-run admission and intentional-failure probes without readiness timers or retries.
- **Implementation** — Pinned licensed Inter Regular 4.1 bytes and provenance; added deterministic HarfRust 0.12.0 and exact-version-gated HarfBuzz 13.0.0 oracle producers, explicit UTF-16 corpus/differential evidence, a hashed Chromium HTML/CSS visual reference, mandatory package E2E, and the shared browser baker scenario over the canonical fixture.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 1.2 with one strict registry execution path shared by interactive, Vitest, Vitexec, and browser-headless surfaces; added stdout/file raw export and nonzero independent core/baker JavaScript and Wasm size reports with explicit unavailable future entries.
- **Decision** — Closed milestone 0 after maintainer approval of all contract decisions and acceptance criteria through 3.3; pinned HarfRust 0.12.0, HarfBuzz 13.0.0, Unicode 17.0.0, the glTF schema revision and validator, ABI/format versions, and initial generator versions in a generated code contract and Diátaxis reference.
- **Implementation** — Closed roadmap item 0.2 with distributive React props checked against React 19 and React Three Fiber, exact `useFont`/lazy-raster inference, expanded negative composition fixtures, and an executable ESM-only manifest contract test.
- **Decision** — Accepted milestone 0.1's Three.js-first core, thin nested-text React wrapper, canonical baked-sibling URL rules, ESM-only exports, open typed raster capabilities, non-generic runtime objects, `defineFont` composition, canonical raster identity, and static bitmap strike contracts for V0.
- **Governance** — Added an in-place milestone-0.1 acceptance checklist and evidence matrix that distinguish mechanically proven TypeScript/ESM contracts from decisions still awaiting explicit maintainer approval.
- **Governance** — Added one enforced OKF concept per workspace package; validation now fails for missing, duplicate, misdirected, nonexistent, or source-stale package entries, while deterministic digest generation excludes build outputs and installed dependencies.
- **Correction** — Confirmed the baker already delegates font parsing to Fontations `read-fonts`/`skrifa`, replaced its custom outline-bounds pen with Skrifa's maintained glyph bounds, and explicitly paused out-of-order milestone-2 expansion until milestones 0–1 close.
- **Migration** — Upgraded the complete documentation bundle and its repository-local maintenance skill to OKF v0.2: concepts now carry `generated.by`/`generated.at` and frontmatter `sources`, the root declares v0.2, the log uses its reserved structure, and the reusable migration/validation commands reject legacy metadata.
- **Implementation** — Added `benches` with the responsive desktop/mobile Figma shell, semantic CSS-variable-backed Tailwind utilities, local shadcn-derived controls, shared target/scenario runner, URL state, raw export, deterministic synthetic target, and fixture-driven Rust Wasm baker target; raster targets remain visibly unavailable.
- **Verification** — Added six Vitest contract tests, a committed erasable-TypeScript Vitexec live runner probe, a 390×844 Playwright mobile scene/controls/report/export probe, browser-error-to-test-failure enforcement, and captured local desktop/mobile visual evidence without readiness timers or retries.
- **Tooling** — Enabled the current Vite React Compiler integration plus Oxlint compiler analysis, Rules of Hooks, accessibility checks, and the strict Oxlint-compatible `react-you-might-not-need-an-effect` rules; effect-only events use `useEffectEvent` rather than render-time refs.
- **Update** — Settled the benchmark application foundation on Vite, React 19, React Compiler, modern async React, the Figma-backed custom shadcn-derived component set, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Vitest, and Vitexec; the existing baker is the first real non-rendering target and unavailable rasters expose capability state rather than fabricated results.
- **Update** — Required canonical Vitexec probes to be committed erasable TypeScript wired to shared Vitest scenario/assertion helpers; admission forbids timer/frame-count readiness and retries, requires causal completion signals, isolation, negative controls, and recorded zero-retry repetition evidence.
- **Update** — Split app testing into hermetic CI and a maintainer-local Vitexec/Vitest live-probe lane; visible hardware-GPU evidence may reuse headed or remote Playwright, while unsupported headless capabilities never count as passes.
- **Update** — Defined layered GLB validation across container parsing, the pinned Khronos validator, draft extension JSON Schemas, project semantic invariants, embedded payload validation, real-loader round trips, and malformed assets.
- **Update** — Defined the canonical unit, package-integration, product-E2E, conformance, and performance test ladder; the shared `benches` scenario registry owns real-product E2E and accepts timings only after correctness passes.
- **Update** — Split the font-baker tests into explicit unit, integration, and real-font vertical-slice lanes; the real-font lane remains conditional until the repository pins its licensed canonical fixture.
- **Update** — Replaced the hand-authored baker ABI JSON with a Rust compile-time generator and built-in `generate-abi` command; the Wasm embed and published package artifact now come from the same compiled contract.
- **Update** — Kept transport compression out of the `no_std` Wasm core; raw byte accounting is authoritative there, while Node/reporting hosts complete gzip and Brotli measurements.
- **Update** — Changed the Wasm allocator from a settled `dlmalloc` choice to an ABI-private experiment: `dlmalloc` remains the working baseline, `rlsf` is the primary reusable-memory challenger, and `lol_alloc` is conditional on a one-shot Worker lifecycle.
- **Update** — Settled the portable baker boundary on one `no_std + alloc` `wasm32-unknown-unknown` module, a JSON-described C ABI, direct TypeScript linear-memory access, and no native-binary, WASI, or generated-binding requirement.
- **Update** — Added the internal `packages/font-baker` Rust/Wasm/TypeScript package and linked [implementation status](planning/font-baker-implementation.md) from the canonical planning surfaces.
- **Update** — Added explicit status markers to the canonical roadmap without changing milestone dependencies or exit gates.
