# Package reference: `@pmndrs/glyph-example-renderer`

Application-encountered types come from the Glyph root; renderer-neutral construction helpers come from `/core`.

Status: Active external-renderer proof. It drives a real immutable font through the public root `GlyphConfig`, Codec,
resource realization, borrowed `CommandBufferView`, and concrete TypeGPU/WebGPU submission without Three.js.

The package is a standing consumer proof. Production source imports only `@pmndrs/glyph`, the example raster package, and
the raster's explicit `/typegpu` shader subpath—never `internal/`, `generated/`, a removed `/core` subpath, `/three`, or
Three itself. Its Codec supplies its own system lane, capability set, transform mode, and program
namespace while reusing the raster format's portable Codec body. The portable body receives no system-buffer object;
package-private host assembly adds stable identity and the engine-owned placement slot after body authentication. The
package root exposes a custom `source` condition for
opted-in workspace tools; default consumers resolve built ESM and declarations.

The ordinary proof begins with `await glyph.init()` and `glyph.handle(name, defineExampleConfig(device))`. Its seven-field
config uses `schema`, required custom-format `fonts`, `encode`, `resolve`, `renderer`, `root`, and optional `commands`. `encode()` selects
`exampleCodecDescriptor(ids)`. `resolve()` leases portable resources. The internal trusted projector binds schema values
and gives the configured renderer a borrowed `CommandBufferView<ExampleBindings>` whose nested `DisplayList` preserves
Rust-authored order. Numeric IDs and raw plan tables never reach the renderer.

The exported factory names one `ExampleGlyphConfig` return boundary because TypeScript `--isolatedDeclarations` cannot
emit the type of a nontrivial exported call expression. That alias derives the bindings and root boundary from
`ExampleSchema` and names `ExampleFontFormats`; every DSL callback and the resulting handle/root/Text types infer without
casts or repeated callback annotations. This is an emitted-library signature requirement, not annotation ceremony for an
application's inline structural config.

The package's `ExampleRootImplementation` receives only constrained `GlyphRootServices` plus `GlyphHandleFonts` and uses
them to construct adapter `ExampleText` objects with a private immutable Font lease. Semantic mutations invalidate that root; the application publishes all dirty roots through the
single top-level `glyph.shape()` boundary. The integration never constructs or receives a public engine, backend, planner,
or target. The returned handle fronts one anonymous root, and `handle(name)` selects idempotent terminal named siblings.
Applications and benchmarks use that surface exactly as they use the first-party Three handle.

During each synchronous `decode(view)`, the configured device walks already-bound programs, buffers, resources, batches,
root instances, and instance spans. Candidate resources, retained buffers, patches, geometry, and draws are staged in
local maps; `commit()` swaps them atomically, while `discard()` leaves the previous accepted device state untouched. Only
accepted renderer-owned state survives after the borrowed view expires.

The example Codec consumes stable glyph identity and placement-slot occurrence identity as distinct system semantics.
The renderer receives the root-scoped f32x2 placement table outside the Codec plan, resolves each physical record's slot,
and materializes its own direct offset stream before adding that offset once to the raster-local origin. This intentionally
shows that Codec authors describe raster meaning while renderer adapters own memory-layout choices; neither the slot nor
the shared table becomes a batch or draw key.

`RecordingExampleRendererDevice` is the deterministic CPU oracle. It reads already-bound raster format, program, variant,
named buffers, geometry, resources, ordered batches/root instances, and instance spans before one commit changes accepted
state. It validates only renderer and user/config requirements; it does not revalidate trusted Rust hierarchy semantics.
Rejected candidates discard staging and leave accepted state untouched.

`TypeGpuExampleRendererDevice` is the concrete renderer device. It realizes GLB-like position, UV, and index accessors;
creates TypeGPU/WebGPU vertex, index, raster-instance, and adapter-local occurrence-origin buffers; builds the selected pipeline;
encodes an indexed instanced pass; and submits to an offscreen `rgba8unorm` target. A retained width change preserves draw
count and existing raster-local bytes, changes the occurrence origins, and must match a cold root at the same width.
Empty idle deltas produce no submission, while accepted removal clears the target. The hardware recovery proof disposes
the lost-device handle and creates a new handle with a new configured device,
then reuses the same loaded FontFace selection and reconstructs the retained text. Device replacement is therefore not a hidden
mutation on an ordinary handle.

The acceptance fixture bakes Inter, declares and loads a typed `glyph.fontFace()` selection, creates a configured Glyph
handle, acquires an independent immutable Font lease inside its Text, and publishes initial and updated retained state
through `glyph.shape()`. It asserts non-empty draws, required named buffers and
geometry, changed visible pixels, idle submission suppression, failure atomicity, exact retirement, and disposal. The
fixture also proves retained-width/cold equivalence and that a rejected update leaves the prior accepted resources and
submissions intact. The hardware lab additionally proves recovery on a second handle. Glyph's package-private tests retain borrowed expiry,
publication ownership, and worker-transfer coverage without exposing those mechanisms to integrators.

See [Example renderer](../planning/example-renderer.md) for why the package exists and how it divides
work with the raster-format-owned `/typegpu` shader subpath.
