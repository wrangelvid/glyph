# Package reference: `@pmndrs/glyph`

Status: foundation merged; stable and canary publishing configured while publishing-feature stacks continue

The release workflow publishes main-branch pushes under npm's `canary` tag. A pushed `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` Git tag
publishes under `latest` only when it matches the package manifest version exactly. Both paths build and check the
package before publishing through the existing npm trusted publisher. Prepare each release's version separately,
then cut its stable tag from the reviewed commit after CI passes.

## Ownership

The package owns six runtime layers:

| Layer                    | Owner                                                                                        | Responsibility                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root runtime and config  | TypeScript core                                                                              | Initialize one Glyph engine, construct named adapter handles, and coordinate projection/decode/commit transactions.                   |
| Font and raster loading  | TypeScript core                                                                              | Read portable GLB envelopes, register shaping payloads, decode selected raster resources, and retain font identity.                   |
| Shaping and layout       | Rust/Wasm                                                                                    | Unicode analysis, bidi, font fallback, shaping, line composition, positioning, ellipsis, and semantic query state.                    |
| Codec and command buffer | Rust/Wasm                                                                                    | Interpret a validated Codec, pack canonical raster-format records, coalesce dirty ranges, and emit a compact command buffer.          |
| Three.js integration     | `@pmndrs/glyph/three`                                                                        | Compile Codec programs, resolve font/material resources, apply command-buffer deltas, upload dirty ranges, and maintain draw proxies. |
| TypeGPU Three experiment | `@pmndrs/glyph/three/typegpu`                                                                | Experimental Three config and shader adapters backed by `/shaders/typegpu`; shares scene and lifecycle classes with `/three`.         |
| `@pmndrs/glyph/react`    | Reconcile React values into the same imperative `Text` and `TextGroup` objects.              |
| `@pmndrs/glyph/vue`      | Reconcile Vue values into the same imperative `Text` and `TextGroup` objects through TresJS. |

Runtime Rust and all shared Rust code remain `no_std + alloc` compatible with the package allocator contract. The optional
font-baker Wasm alone enables a feature-gated `std` adapter for Fontations subsetting; the same crate continues to
pass its `wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features` build. The text engine uses the existing compile-time direct-memory mapping
for font registrations. Ordinary publication enters once through
`pmndrs_glyph_engine_update_batch(entriesPointer, count)`, whose entries address the already-written request slice and
one borrowed result arena for each dirty root. Paragraph-scoped semantic queries remain separate synchronous calls.
TypeScript does not independently shape, lay out, or pack paragraphs.

The root `glyph` runtime initializes one engine idempotently. `glyph.handle(name, config)` creates independent mutable
adapter state; live names are unique and become reusable after disposal. Every handle owns one anonymous root and fronts
that root's API directly. Calling `handle(name)` selects one idempotent live terminal sibling root, so roots cannot nest and
Text/TextGroup objects cannot be rootless. `glyph.shape()` stages every dirty root across all live handles and submits them
in one engine batch; unchanged roots do not cross into Wasm, and renderer-specific transform synchronization remains a
separate cheap path.

`GlyphConfig` contains `schema`, optional `fonts`, `encode`, `resolve`, `renderer`, `root`, and optional `commands`.
`encode()` selects the Codec that defines packed command-buffer data. The engine owns those internal bytes and projects
trusted data through the schema and resolver into a borrowed `CommandBufferView`; its nested `DisplayList` preserves
authoritative batch/root-instance order. `GlyphRenderer.decode(view)` stages retained host objects and returns the
transactional result/commit/discard boundary. The host renderer later traverses or submits committed objects. There is no
configurable intermediate decoder and ordinary renderer code receives no numeric IDs.

The producer boundary is the proof boundary. Application and integration inputs are validated where they enter the public
GlyphConfig services; package-owned retained state is then trusted. Rust validates raw ABI requests where memory safety
requires it and emits the canonical publication layout. JavaScript reads that package-owned publication directly rather
than rescanning every table, scalar, and registration on every frame.
Rust encoder and transport tests pin every emitted table span and payload rebase, while multi-handle product tests prove
root, Codec, and font ownership across a shared engine batch. A failed owned invariant is a package defect covered by those
tests, not an application-facing recovery path repeated in the hot runtime.

Portable fonts are schema-validated when Glyph bakes them. The rendering loader does not ship AJV or the Khronos glTF
validator: it checks the GLB envelope, the reserved `PMNDRS_font` extension and compatible version identity, then proves
only the buffer-view ranges needed to create safe typed-array views. Generated TypeScript types preserve the checked-in
extension schema at that trust boundary. A malformed payload throws when its required data is read or decoded; runtime
does not repeat bake-time schema, SFNT, checksum, or whole-document semantic validation. Runtime OTF/TTF baking follows
the same rule for GLBs returned by Glyph's own bakers; the Node `/bake` entry explicitly retains full validation before
raster work and after composition. The size graph rejects the validator, AJV, and Khronos implementation from the
runtime Worker's initial bundle.

`defineGlyphConfig()` preserves the schema, font vocabulary, renderer result, boundary, root, and Codec as one inferred
relationship. `GlyphConfigFor<typeof Schema, Root, Result>` gives isolated declaration boundaries a nameable contract
without repeating the schema's binding tuple or boundary type. Internal handle machinery owns Codec installation, planning, projection, resource
settlement, and disposal; third-party integrations receive only constrained root services. Every FontFace and handle reaches
the same process-local, lease-counted font resource graph. Low-level loading and acquisition are internal services rather
than a second application or integrator API. A consumer loads a FontFace selection; Text then owns the
independent immutable Font lease needed by its engine binding. Portable compiled resources remain immutable payload data,
while each renderer owns physical textures, buffers, geometry, and their device-relative leases.

The `/core` entry contains only renderer-neutral authoring operations. Package registries and identity maps, compiled
Codec-body authentication, system-lane normalization, and Glyph's reserved built-in raster registration path stay under
`src/internal`; they are neither root exports nor wildcard subpath APIs. Integrators can register their own portable raster
Codecs through `registerRasterCodec()` and can normalize a renderer-owned capability set explicitly when composing
config helpers.

The three renderer-neutral raster implementations retain portable Codec-registration side effects when selected from the root. Built-in
Three configs select a private typed shader set carried by each handle's renderer resources, with no module-global switch. `/three` and `/shaders/tsl` preserve the native TSL implementation from `main`; `/three/typegpu` selects the migrated adapters over `/shaders/typegpu`. Both handle variants can coexist. Applications import portable formats from the root and shader builders from the shared backend entry, `/shaders/tsl` or `/shaders/typegpu`.
Every TypeScript subpath also publishes a custom `source` condition. Workspace Vite applications opt into that condition
for direct TS/TSX hot reload, while ordinary Node and package consumers continue to resolve built declarations and ESM.
Wasm and `package.json` exports remain distribution artifacts because they have no TypeScript source equivalent.

The font-baker Rust source, direct-memory wrapper, schemas, tests, build pipeline, optimized Wasm, and generated ABI are
owned by this package. There is no separately published font-baker package. The root entry has no static edge to the
baker, its `std`-enabled dependencies, Ajv, glTF Validator, or the baker Wasm; only explicit bake/runtime-bake surfaces can
load those bytes.

The TypeScript paragraph engine, paragraph batches/attachments, direct shaping exports, and the text-preparation Worker
are removed. The `/typegpu` adapter uses the Codec command buffer and public GlyphConfig services. The separate
`@pmndrs/glyph/shaders/typegpu` publishes the experimental raster-format realizations as typed functions for any WebGPU host; `typegpu` is an optional peer and the root entry
has no static edge to it.

The analytic Slug fill algorithm lives in `src/shaders/typegpu/slug/core` as TypeGPU shader functions over plain values,
and nothing in that directory imports a renderer.[^slug-shader-core] The stable q-form solver, root-eligibility table,
per-curve coverage and antialiasing weight, band header and reference bit layout, screen-space scale, thickening,
weighted blend, and row-based vertex dilation are expressed once. A vertical band is the horizontal band in the
transposed frame with the opposite winding sense, so both axes share one curve evaluator and quadratic solver.

The neighboring TypeGPU modules own page texture reads, grid addressing, band traversal, and the sorted-reference
terminator. The experimental `/three/typegpu` host supplies textures and node-valued glyph fields through `@typegpu/three`, while retaining
native TSL only for the writable inter-stage varying and the matrix-compatible dilation path. A device-free package test
compiles the staged Slug graph through Three's WGSL and GLSL node builders and guards unique shared-function declarations,
both bounded band loops and terminators, and cross-backend builtin compatibility.

`typegpu`, `@typegpu/three`, and `@typegpu/gl` are optional peers because their runtime identities must be shared with the
consumer, like Three.js and React. Stable `/three` and `/shaders/tsl` consumers do not load these bridge runtimes, and
package-size measurements externalize those peer graphs while retaining the package's emitted shader metadata.

The supported peer floors are Three.js 0.185.0, React 19.0.0, R3F 9.7.0 or 10.0.0-alpha.4, TypeGPU 0.12.5,
`@typegpu/gl` 0.12.4, and `@typegpu/three` 0.12.1. Development dependencies remain pinned independently.
Shared renderer development versions come from the `renderer` catalog in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; public peer ranges remain
explicit compatibility contracts. `@types/three` remains an independent exact pin because DefinitelyTyped patch releases
do not move in lockstep with the Three.js runtime package.
React's `use` establishes the React 19 floor; benchmark and example applications additionally use React 19.2
`Activity` and effect events. The R3F range is `>=9.7.0 <10 || >=10.0.0-alpha.4 <11`; 9.7.0 is the selected
stable v9 baseline. The adapter imports the common R3F entry. R3F v9 applications provide an initialized
`WebGPURenderer` through the async `gl` factory; v10 applications can also use `/webgpu`.
Glyph registers named host constructors because v10's root and `/webgpu` entries share a catalogue but have
separate factory-extension counters. Factory registration from both entries can otherwise replace Glyph's constructors.
Until R3F shares its runtime across entries, mixing them adds about 41 kB gzip in the example application
(verified with alpha.4 and canary.d91831d). Adapter-only package-size checks externalize peers; the production
R3F hello-world measurement includes the complete consumer graph so pull-request comparisons expose this cost.
The v10 alpha.4 baseline supports the package's Node lifecycle tests and requires Three >=0.185.0. The TypeGPU bridge's texture
overload first appears in `@typegpu/three` 0.12.1; the GLSL derivative operations require TypeGPU 0.12.5 and
`@typegpu/gl` 0.12.4.

`mise exec -- pnpm scripts run glyph:peer-check` first rebuilds Glyph, then copies that distribution, source, and focused
tests into a temporary isolated consumer. It installs the declared minimum peers (including React 19.0 declarations),
checks the example-raster package at the same Three and TypeGPU floors, and verifies the TSL regression, public
source/declaration fixtures, shader generation, and React lifecycles. V10 checks exercise both the root and `/webgpu`
entries. Add `--browser` to verify custom WebGPURenderer setup, visible text and retained updates on WebGPU and WebGL2
using Playwright Chromium. The existing lifecycle suite includes the cross-entry host registration regression.
The temporary consumer is removed on exit. Exact `--three`,
`--fiber`, `--react` and `--typegpu` overrides allow checking a candidate without changing workspace installs.
Compatibility coverage includes host registration, font leases, retained updates, and WebGPU/WebGL2 rendering
at both R3F baselines with React 19.0.0 and the other minimum peers.
Three 0.185.0 also passed the native TSL and TypeGPU-backed browser proofs for Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, decorations, retained updates and custom material
composition on both WebGPU and WebGL2 through `benchmark:v1-bitmap` and its `--typegpu` variant.

The package-owned `glyph` executable is available through `pnpm exec`; its `bake` command supports both project discovery
and a direct known-font mode. Its stable packaged shim delegates to the built Node CLI, so workspace installs can link the
executable before `dist` exists. Direct mode accepts one input/output pair, a collection face, optional shaping-font
Unicode subsetting through the package-owned Fontations/Skera baker Wasm, and independently selected embedded Bitmap,
MSDF, and Slug rasters. The prepared source bytes feed the core shaping bake and every selected raster bake; neither the
CLI nor the programmatic `@pmndrs/glyph/bake` path invokes a platform font tool. `--check`
publishes only to temporary storage and compares the complete GLB byte-for-byte with the requested output. It calls the
same `bakeFont` host as programmatic consumers rather than maintaining an example-only composition path.

Project discovery uses Oxc Parser 0.150.0 for JS/JSX/TS/TSX syntax, Oxc Walker 1.1.1 for lexical scopes, and Oxc Resolver 11.24.2 for
module resolution, including tsconfig paths and TypeScript source extension aliases. It scans `src` by default or the
explicit entry files, then follows project-local ESM imports and re-exports. It resolves literal options and imported
constants without executing application modules or starting a TypeScript compiler. Shadowed names do not inherit an
import's meaning; cyclic constants and ambiguous exports remain dynamic diagnostics. Module-relative font URLs resolve
from their declaring file. TypeScript remains a repository development dependency only. The isolated packed consumer
bakes an actual font through the CLI with neither TypeScript nor Babel installed. These regressions run through the
existing `pnpm --filter @pmndrs/glyph test` command.
Oxc Parser declares Node `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`; this change is verified on the pinned Node 24.18.0, not a broader Node
support matrix. Browser entry points do not load these Node tools. Oxc Walker collects declarations before resolving
references, so hoisted and shadowed names retain their lexical identity. Reassigned constants remain dynamic.

Direct baking may add `--glyph-map <path>` to publish a deterministic JSON object mapping authored glyph names to code
points from the same `--unicodes` selection and collection face as the font artifact. The font and lookup publish as one
rollback-safe output set, while `--check` verifies both byte-for-byte. Unnamed mappings are omitted. A name with multiple
selected code points is rejected as ambiguous so the caller must narrow the Unicode set rather than accepting an
order-dependent alias.

The `glyph glyphs` command uses the same package-owned baker Wasm and Skrifa to enumerate Unicode mappings, exact glyph
IDs, and names retained in a font's `post` or CFF data. Exact repeatable `--name` filters can emit structured JSON or a
compressed `--unicode-set` accepted by `glyph bake --unicodes`. Fonts without authored names still expose exact IDs rather
than invented semantic labels. Rich vendor labels and aliases remain external catalog data.

R3F `Text` and `TextGroup` never accept handle or root props. The adapter obtains both from one immutable React context: a
provider-selected `ThreeHandle` or terminal `ThreeRoot` when present, otherwise the Canvas-local default root on one
module-owned default Three handle that calls idempotent `glyph.init()` and installs `ThreeConfig` once. `handle="surface"`
is shorthand for the idempotent `defaultHandle('surface')` named root. A provider captures its initial selection and `fontFaces` alias table and never updates
the context value; selecting another root, handle, or alias table requires remounting the provider. Context is constructor dependency
injection only: it owns no engine, runtime, scene, renderer, canvas, publication cursor, or semantic resource cache, and
it never disposes an externally owned handle or FontFace. It disposes only FontFaces it declared from shorthand table
entries. Supplying `fontFaces` or `fallback` adds a local Suspense boundary; `errorFallback(error, dismiss)` handles only
`GlyphFontError` and rethrows unrelated errors. Recovery is explicit: the caller repairs the resource, then invokes
`dismiss()` to retry the child tree. Imperative construction uses `handle.createText()` and `handle.createTextGroup()` for the
anonymous root, or `handle(name).createText()` and `handle(name).createTextGroup()` for a named root.

React font selection has three coexisting public paths. A caller-owned FontFace may be passed directly to outer or nested
Text; `useFont` and the typed `useBitmap`/`useMsdf`/`useSlug` leaves own hook-created declarations and mounted Font
leases; and `GlyphProvider.fontFaces` supplies optional subtree-local string aliases from sources, `{ src, format? }`, or
caller-owned FontFaces. All three use the same Glyph resource graph. `suspend-react` retains only stable Promise/error
identity across React retries, and is not a semantic font cache. See [React font loading](../guides/react.md).

The Vue adapter mirrors that contract for TresJS. Its `Text` and `TextGroup` are `defineComponent` render functions
that construct the same retained Three classes through the Tres catalogue under private tag names; applications never
use those tags. The paragraph style list is the `textStyle` prop rather than `style`, because Vue normalizes any
array-valued `style` prop into one merged object while creating the vnode, before setup can observe the list; `layout`
and `constraints` keep their names because Vue leaves them untouched. Nested `<Text>` slots flatten into inline spans
without mounting, constructor `args` stay referentially stable for the life of a node because Tres rebuilds an instance
when they change, and a root or `pixelSnapping` change remounts through the element key. One default Glyph root exists
per `TresCanvas`, retained by reference count with a one-microtask grace period, because a root may not span two
Scenes. Vue has no render-phase suspension: a paragraph mounts nothing until every FontFace selection is loaded, starts
missing loads together, and keeps the current paragraph while a later selection loads. `useFont` returns
`{ font, error, ready }` shallow refs plus a promise for async setup; the format leaves compose it exactly like the
React hooks. See [Vue and TresJS font loading](../guides/vue.md).

Both component adapters snapshot paragraph property data and treat each committed prop set as complete desired state:
removing style, layout, constraints, flow, material, or raster pixel ratio restores the corresponding default. Vue reads
through nested reactive records while taking those snapshots, so in-place changes trigger updates without retaining
mutable comparison state. `TextGroup` material and render order follow the same rule through one shared imperative
apply step rather than framework prop diffing, so removing either restores the Three default. Paragraph and group
updates request a frame on demand-rendered canvases only when the desired snapshot changed; a re-render with identical
props requests nothing. A pending Vue font switch keeps the current Three object and its leases until replacement fonts
are ready; constructor arguments remain valid for that mounted object's lifetime. React retains its ordinary Suspense
lifecycle.

`pnpm scripts run glyph:adapters-check` runs the shared React/Vue behavior cases and each framework's lifecycle tests
against a freshly built distribution, plus adapter formatting, lint, and source declaration checks. Shared cases cover
prop removal, nested property replacement, frame requests with an identical-snapshot negative control, flow retention
and removal, group material and render-order removal, loaded-to-pending font switches, and lease disposal; Vue also
proves in-place reactive updates. Three's `Text.set({ material: undefined })` explicitly clears an override.

The public `ThreeRoot` contract stops at that retained scene API: identity and disposal, Text/TextGroup construction,
counts, and mutable material presentation. The renderer draw object, discovered Three Scene, root services, command
boundary, and Font lease acquisition belong to the package-owned root host. They are unavailable through both source
conditions and built declarations; package internals recover the host through private identity rather than exposing a
second renderer/runtime object to applications.

`Text` publishes ink through Three's object-level `boundingBox` contract and carries one package-private shared empty
`BufferGeometry` marker so `Box3.setFromObject()` visits those bounds in ordinary and precise modes. The marker has no
vertex payload, child, draw, per-Text allocation, serialization, or raycast behavior. Before the first rendered frame,
Box3 requests one positioned measurement containing only the paragraph summary and lines; later traversal reuses the
revision-aware measurement cache. Drei Center/Bounds can therefore consume transformed paragraph boxes without coupling
authored objects to renderer-owned batch meshes or copying the per-glyph columns.

The unbundled source graph follows the same boundary. `/three/raster-program` exposes the custom-raster
registration DSL but keeps compiled snapshots and renderer lifecycle state under the denied `/three/internal/*` tree.
Mixed implementation modules for Text, detached Glyphs/Decorations, frame translation, and measurement are exact-denied
as direct package paths; the curated `/three` entry re-exports only their supported classes, functions, and result types.
Likewise, `defineGlyphConfig()` returns inert structural data with no hidden callable factory; the config leaf exports the
declaration DSL, while only `glyph.handle(name, config)` enters package-private construction. Spreading or wrapping a
config preserves its inferred handle/root type and may override fields without depending on exact object identity.

`ThreeCodec` exposes only the ordinary `Codec` contract an application can encounter through `ThreeConfig`. The
compiled Three raster programs and renderer-resource pool are recovered through package-owned Codec identity inside the
adapter; they are not public properties and do not force `@pmndrs/glyph/three` to re-export an internal type. R3F's
implementation uses one package-private Three construction bridge because it creates the same retained Three objects;
that bridge does not create another runtime or an alternate renderer integration API.

Glyph initialization retains one settled `Promise<void>` forever, whether it fulfills or rejects: concurrent and later
`glyph.init()` calls receive the same object. Initialization failure is fatal for that module lifetime, so an error path
cannot repeatedly allocate large Wasm memories; a full page or module replacement is the retry boundary. Vite HMR carries
the process-local Glyph runtime through replacement data instead of instantiating a second engine. React still checks
synchronous initialized and loaded state first, so ready renders do not enter Suspense or cross a microtask. Pending font
loads use `suspend-react` only as React's stable suspension cache; Glyph's FontFace resource graph remains the semantic
cache and lease owner. Each FontFace selection retains one Promise for the lifetime of its declaration-owned load record;
disposing the face releases that record, and a rejected font operation is evicted so an explicit later load can retry.

The R3F `Text` component infers the raster-format union from a required outer font selection, including a font stack chosen
from runtime state. Callers retain that inferred union rather than widening dynamic selections to an erased catch-all. A nested `Text` is flattened into
an inline styled run and may omit `font` because it inherits from its enclosing paragraph; a rendered outer `Text`
without a font is invalid. Nested text creates no Three object and accepts only `children`, `font`, `style`, `paint`, and
`material`. Because JSX erases the generic element identity needed to reject every box-only prop statically, the
flattener validates this boundary synchronously and names any invalid property instead of silently discarding it.
`TextGroup` owns nestable hierarchy and presentation inheritance, never font inheritance or a planner boundary. Both mounted components register their Three
objects with the R3F host and are constructed during its commit rather than in a layout effect. React `Activity` can
therefore pre-render a hidden text or whole text group, while R3F retains visibility and eventual disposal ownership.

Structural `txt`/`span` values and nested React `<Text>` are the only public rich-text authoring paths. They compile one
immutable string and internal span records, then resolve their derived joins onto the extended grapheme-cluster grid
before a frame is built (D-265). Public `Text` and `Text.set()` inputs reject a parallel raw `spans` field;
callers therefore cannot forge offsets, split a cluster, or keep a mutable range table synchronized with text. Internal
alignment remains a compiler backstop because concatenation can fuse the tail of one fragment with the head of the next.

A frame the engine refuses names its cause and the input that caused it (D-267). Six caller-actionable statuses --
`styleRangeInvalid`, `styleSplitsCluster`, `styleNestingInvalid`, `styleRootInvalid`, `fontStackMissing`,
`fontMetricsMissing` -- are separated from `invalidRequest`, which keeps every internal invariant violation and names
nothing. Each carries the offending paragraph and style in two u32s of the result header's existing tail padding, so the
header size and every prior field offset are unchanged. `/three` re-raises them as `TextFrameError`, whose `rejection` is
a discriminated union over the cause and affected `Text`; span bookkeeping remains private to the structural compiler.

Publicly constructible frame inputs are validated where they enter `Text`, `TextGroup`, Codec assembly, or
font registration; malformed data never waits for scene traversal to fail. A residual engine rejection therefore names an
internal invariant defect through `TextFrameError` while the last committed draw state remains live. Renderer preparation is
separate: if an engine-accepted publication cannot realize its resources or material, Three discards the candidate, keeps
the last accepted draw state and fences, and retains the error. It does not retry unchanged frames. Explicit material or
other renderer-relevant invalidation requests a checkpoint from the last consumed command revision. A malformed emitted plan
is an engine defect and never enters this recovery path (D-285).

`registerThreeRasterProgram` refuses a format registered after a runtime has read the registry (D-271), naming the
raster format instead of applying to nothing. Snapshot tracking uses weak registry references, so an abandoned runtime cannot
keep its identity registry alive or permanently poison later registration after collection. `/three` also re-exports
`ParagraphLayoutSummary`, `GlyphLayoutInspection`, `BorrowedGlyphLayout`, `BorrowedGlyph`, `ParagraphLayout`,
`ParagraphMeasurement`, and `FontFeature`, so a `/three` importer can name every Three text query result.

One baked GLB may expose several raster formats without repeating its input identity. The ordinary declaration and loading
surface is `glyph.fontFace(source, { family?, format? })`; root does not export `loadFont`, `createFontLibrary`, or
`FontLibrary`, and there is no public font-library leaf. Package-owned loading services preserve custom transport and
runtime-bake support behind the FontFace declaration. The face is
its aggregate/default selection, `.default` aliases
it, and declared keys such as `.bitmap`, `.msdf`, or `.slug` are distinct inferred format selections. The declaration
owns loading: `face.load()` loads every authoritative imported format advertised by the main font plus every declared
exact format, while `face.slug.load()` loads only that exact declared format. `face.formats()` inspects the authoritative
main GLB without fetching sidecars and returns its frozen, ordered format keys. Successful calls preserve Promise and
result identity; rejected calls are evicted for retry. The consuming handle supplies its configured default key when an
undeclared face is passed to Text; imperative Three rejects an unloaded selected format before creating retained state.
Explicit `Text.measure()` and `Text.glyphs()` calls synchronously query one Text through its selected handle. They may pay
one additional Wasm crossing, but do not traverse a scene, publish commands, or realize renderer resources. Normal
rendering still publishes every dirty root through one `glyph.shape()` crossing. A query reconciles render-active root
members plus the explicitly queried Text; querying an attached sibling cannot bind an unrelated detached Text, while a
detached Text can still measure or inspect itself without entering the rendered batch. The former renderer-free
`createParagraph()` path was removed because its private engine, handle, Codec, planner, font bindings, and caches
duplicated the GlyphConfig pipeline (D-339).

The Three root keeps only the current detached query publicly bound and parks at most one preceding detached controller
outside active publication membership. Alternating two detached measurements or inspections therefore reuses each
controller's revision-aware semantic cache without accumulating removal rows, while a third distinct query evicts the
single parked controller. Scene publication also evicts that slot. This bound permits at most one dormant core
inspection cache; `Text.glyphs()` still returns freshly copied, caller-owned columns on every call.

`Text.withGlyphs(callback)` is the shared core, Three, and TypeGPU demand-read alternative for callers that need only a
few glyphs. Its fixed descriptor serializes no per-glyph semantic table; each indexed access copies one retained Rust
glyph into fixed Wasm scratch, then returns one frozen scalar object in O(selected) work. Full `glyphs()` remains the
bulk caller-owned copy. The callback must finish synchronously:
thenables, engine reentry, and retained-text mutation are rejected, and the indexed view expires on return or throw.

Attached live deformation is accepted as the future D-356 design but is not shipped by either adapter. The current
`Text` surface has no `transformGlyphs()` or `clearGlyphTransforms()` methods and allocates no attached matrix sidecar.
A separately scoped follow-up must prove coordinated Three and TypeGPU storage, lifecycle, interaction geometry, and
performance before exposing that API. Existing detached `Glyphs` transforms and `copyGlyphs()`/`breakApart()` remain
the owned, already-shaped manipulation path and intentionally stop following the source `Text`.

The FontFace source cache coalesces canonical-equivalent locators before I/O and converges different locators onto one
parsed main-font node after their complete GLB bytes have the same SHA-256 content identity. Every acquisition base is
retained on that node, so a relative sidecar may fall back across equivalent acquisitions without using its filename as
identity. Per-format variants load lazily and the shared main node retires after its last source lease. Loaded external
raster artifacts retain their authenticated complete bytes, and external raster resources converge by SHA-256 plus byte
length instead of URL or filename. Each raster records only the resource identities it actually resolved, preserving the
dependency graph without copying those resources into every format.

Cross-realm movement is deliberately outside ordinary loading and rendering. Only an explicit `clone()` copies bytes:

```ts
const Inter = glyph.fontFace('/fonts/Inter.font.glb', { format: [msdf, slug] });
const [serialized, transfer] = await Inter.slug.clone();

worker.postMessage(serialized, { transfer });
```

`face.clone()` loads and snapshots the aggregate selection; `face.slug.clone()` loads and snapshots only that exact
selection. Both return fresh full-span `ArrayBuffer`s, so transferring them may detach the clone without changing the
originating FontFace, immutable Font values, or cache. The receiving realm passes the inert, versioned
`SerializedFontFace` directly to `glyph.fontFace(serialized)`. Glyph synchronously claims its buffers into private
ownership. The versioned discriminator selects this cross-realm path; because only Glyph produces the snapshot, the
receiver does not normalize its fields, revalidate its dependency metadata, or re-hash its bytes. Ordinary GLB parsing
still fails at the operation that cannot consume malformed bytes. The lazy importer adopts the main GLB, selected raster
sidecars, and only their resolved external resources into the same content graph used by URL-string, `URL`, and `Blob`
declarations.
A complete existing graph is reused without fetching;
partial transfers may progressively add formats to that graph. No live FontFace, Font, Promise, handle, or renderer
resource crosses the realm boundary, and no normal `load()`, Text construction, `glyph.shape()`, or renderer path invokes
the snapshot code. The initial package graph retains only the synchronous serialized-value discriminator and ownership
claim needed by `glyph.fontFace(serialized)`. Copying a loaded graph and reconstructing missing transferred nodes live in
one package-private dynamic chunk reached only by explicit `clone()` or by loading a serialized declaration. A real
Worker transfer test proves every posted clone buffer detaches in the sender, the receiver reconstructs the selected
format with fetching disabled, and neither realm initializes the shaping engine.

React `<Text>` consumes the same `FontFace` declaration or selection as imperative Three. It asks the selected Three
handle which exact format the declaration denotes and enters the shared `suspend-react` resource only while that format
is unloaded. The selected Text owns an independent immutable Font lease and releases it on unmount. `useFont` and its
typed raster-format wrappers remain conveniences over `glyph.fontFace()`, with matching `.preload()` and `.clear()`;
they do not introduce another loader or resource cache.

Artifact metrics carry text decoration from bake time (D-246): required `underlinePosition`/`underlineThickness` from
`post` and `strikeoutPosition`/`strikeoutSize` from `OS/2`, with a conservative derived fallback when a source font
omits `post`. The loader decodes all four into public `FontMetrics`, and the rich-text conformance lane probes every
font it loads for finite, positive-thickness values. Decoration rendering consumes those metrics end-to-end (D-248):
spans declare `decoration` (solid underline, overline, and line-through; other line styles are rejected at the
boundary), the engine cascade stamps the CSS decorating box so one continuous line spans nested font-size changes at
the declaring span's scale, and records flow through both planners as resource-free rows of the reserved
`pmndrs.decoration` Codec technique. Codec programs carry a primitive kind in the former reserved wire field; underline and
overline rows precede the paragraph's glyphs while line-through follows them, matching CSS paint order, and Three
realizes decorations as separate ordered draw objects. The same `defineTextMaterial()` factory used by glyph formats
receives a `kind: 'glyph' | 'decoration'` discriminated context and may keep or override the default flat-quad TSL
material without mutating the glyph draw. `ThreeTextMaterialContextMap` supplies the exact built-in payloads and is the
augmentation point for a custom Three program's literal format and output types; it does not add an untyped string
fallback. Only glyph branches carry a raster `format`; `pmndrs.decoration` remains an internal Codec/command-buffer
technique identifier. Decorated command-buffer gathers rebuild their output, counting and appending each paint pass
directly from the retained contiguous decoration slice without a transient filtered allocation; the undecorated retained
fast path is unchanged.

When runtime baking is required, one Worker request normalizes the Unicode ranges, prepares the selected source once,
and feeds those exact prepared bytes to the shaping bake and every requested Bitmap, MSDF, or Slug bake. The Worker
composes and validates one canonical GLB before transferring it. Its `asset.generator` is the publishing package identity
`@pmndrs/glyph`, independent of whether the producer was the CLI, Node API, or runtime Worker.

The Worker caches only that final validated GLB in `CacheStorage`; partial preparation and raster outputs never become
cache entries. Identity covers source bytes, face, normalized ranges, ordered raster descriptors and keys, and all
relevant format/baker versions. Persistence is inherited from the source response: `no-store`, `no-cache`, missing
freshness metadata, and already-expired responses remain memory-only, while `max-age` or `Expires` supplies the exact
derived-artifact expiration. Browser quota eviction owns storage pressure. Cache absence, quota rejection, privacy
restrictions, and storage corruption are transparent misses followed by the same canonical bake.

## Retained frame transaction

Every handle owns one anonymous root, and `handle(name)` idempotently selects named sibling roots. Each root owns one Rust
command-buffer stream and one renderer publication boundary. It may bind to at most one Three `Scene`, discovered from its attached Text
members by object identity; a root name is stable semantic/customization metadata, not a `Scene.uuid`. A second Scene
therefore uses another named root. Returned roots are terminal and cannot create deeper roots. `TextGroup` remains freely
nestable for scene hierarchy, transform/visibility inheritance, material selection, pixel snapping, and render order, but
does not create another planner or publication stream. Capacity is immutable `ThreeConfig` policy shared
by the anonymous and named roots of one handle; selecting different policy means creating another handle from
`defineThreeConfig(...)`, not mutating a live root. Per-root, group, Text, and span material selection remains retained
scene state because it describes authored presentation rather than renderer policy. A traversal sends only changed
paragraph sections:

- text replacement sends text plus any dependent style/geometry state;
- font, spans, shaping style, paint, raster ratio, or material send style state;
- content-box changes send geometry;
- transform and visibility changes update Three's renderer-local sidecar without calling Wasm;
- an empty or normalized-equal update sends nothing.

Three's ordinary scene traversal owns world-matrix composition. The root observes Text membership and ancestor state,
publishes semantic changes once at its renderer-owned draw node, and patches root-relative transforms through a separate
engine-free side path. Camera motion does not republish text. Text, nested `TextGroup`, and other ancestor motion,
visibility, reparenting, and manual matrix changes patch only affected renderer-local slots and do not enter Wasm.
Calling `TextGroup.updateMatrixWorld()` directly also observes a changed finite group `renderOrder` and publishes that
presentation change; an unchanged direct traversal remains a no-op. The root-level publication object is a Scene child,
so this order is compared with sibling Scene draw-mesh order rather than inheriting an authored parent `Group.groupOrder`.
Within a `TextGroup`, each child `Text.renderOrder` ranks that paragraph's instances in the shared batch while the nearest
`TextGroup.renderOrder` remains the Three draw-mesh order. Changing only a child rank publishes one transactional
16-byte `(paragraph_id, scope, rank)` sideband record and lets Rust apply the paragraph permutation without resending
text, styles, geometry, measurement, or per-glyph records. Ordinary content updates retain the 12-byte lifecycle record
and omit the sideband when scope and rank are unchanged. An ungrouped
`Text.renderOrder` retains ordinary Three draw-mesh meaning. Paragraph rank is deliberately absent from glyph storage and
draw keys: compatible spans and grouped paragraphs therefore coalesce by resource, material, and fixed paint layer, with
under-decoration, glyph, and over-decoration layers preserving CSS paint order.
When a rank-only permutation keeps the committed Codec, capability, one-batch single-aggregate-draw storage topology,
and renderable stable-ID set, Rust copies the committed physical records into their new order and publishes write patches only. It transactionally
updates its internal aggregate primitive/draw spans but does not republish unchanged buffers, resources, primitives,
draws, or retirements. Recordless source glyphs remain in retained semantic state but are excluded from the renderable-ID
permutation exactly as they are from Codec output. Any incompatible topology falls back to ordinary retained compilation.
The packed-artifact Labs case over 1,000 labels measured 6.62 ms to 3.85 ms p50 (-41.8%, p=.002) with the other 18 matched
benchmarks neutral.
Core preflights uniqueness only when a paragraph is created or its base lifecycle order changes, and validates the final
nonremoved desired set rather than each update in isolation. Atomic base-order swaps therefore remain valid, duplicate
final slots fail before serialization, and rank-only Billboard frames avoid the scan entirely; Rust retains the same
authoritative validation at the ABI boundary. An accepted rank-only frame commits revisions without repeating cached
paragraph measurement calls or bounding-box publication.
Each traversed Text reports only its own current Scene. When that Scene and the renderer-owned draw object are unchanged,
observation returns without allocating or scanning sibling Text instances. A full membership scan is reserved for an
actual Scene transition or a detached draw object, including recovery after a host clears and reattaches the authored
scene tree.

Rust publishes one revision containing:

- engine and command revision headers;
- physical-buffer allocation and retirement commands;
- coalesced per-buffer dirty byte ranges;
- resource bindings;
- ordered draw commands with raster-format/program, resource, material, transform, and clip identity;
- optional semantic measurement or inspection sections only when explicitly demanded.

The root-scoped placement table uses the same capability-selected alignment, coalescing, fragmentation, and whole-buffer
upload policy as retained Codec buffers; it does not carry a separate fixed range-packing heuristic.

Metric-only style changes refresh retained shaping-run typography before cluster aggregation but reuse the HarfRust glyph
result. Font size, letter spacing, word spacing, line height, and baseline changes therefore rebuild advances and
positioning without treating glyph identities as newly shaped content. A public optimized-Wasm regression doubles a
paragraph's font size and proves its retained inline advance doubles; the live Paragraph Stress scene additionally keeps
correct spacing through intermediate animated sizes for Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug.
Line boxes resolve vertical metrics from the font stack's primary face rather than the fallback face selected for an
individual cluster. Natural line height retains nonnegative font leading; an explicit `lineHeight` is authoritative and
may produce negative half-leading, so values below one em remain effective and mixed-script fallback cannot introduce
line-to-line leading jitter.

The Three executor does not infer paragraph layout from GPU records and does not maintain a parallel candidate/current
target state machine. It applies the Rust command buffer transactionally and retains only renderer resources required by
future deltas. Portable payload bytes are already shared by immutable `Font` values; Three's current GPU texture realization remains
root-local. Pooling those immutable device objects above roots is a Three implementation follow-up, not a core scene,
device, render-pass, or implicit-standalone-batch API.

A paragraph's public content box may declare `columns: { count, gap }`, flowing text through side-by-side ordered columns
inside the exact content-box width. Columns fill in order without balancing, so the final column may run short, and an
exact `width` is required because the column advance is derived from it. Internally, Rust already retains bounded rectangle
or polygon regions and exclusions, subtracts them into multiple slots, and composes fragments through sequential regions.
The shared public `TextFlow` surface now admits ordered keyed rectangle or simple-polygon regions, keyed rectangle or
simple-polygon exclusions, margins, and every existing wrap side in paragraph-local inline/block coordinates. Admission
normalizes coordinates to their exact finite f32 wire values, rejects duplicate keys, degenerate or self-intersecting
rings, and freezes normalized state before it reaches the retained planner. Stable keys mint entity IDs independently of
array order, and unchanged entities retain their own geometry revisions when one sibling moves or the flow order changes.
The Three integration binds this renderer-neutral description to the paragraph transform; React forwards the same model.
Exclusion membership is explicitly authored per region. Projection helpers return normalized exclusion values but never
attach them globally: an application may add one projected object to selected columns, omit it so another column renders
behind the object, or project separate copies into different Text-local frames.
The retained Rust geometry authority remains unchanged, zero-exclusion paragraphs allocate no exclusion arena, and the
first nonempty exclusion set reserves 16 retained entries before ordinary geometric growth. Three's former one-exclusion
feature cap is removed without coupling entity capacity to the separate slot-output limit.

For retained exact-width, non-ellipsis flow with stable region/exclusion topology, moving any number of exclusions in one
region now unions their old/new block bounds and margins into one dirty band. Rust retains every preceding line, resumes
the existing band composer at the retained source cursor, and waits until it crosses the complete future dirty horizon
before accepting an exact line/fragment/slot suffix certificate. Structural, cross-region, flexible-width, and ellipsis
changes fall back to the cold authority. Edit-driven and exclusion-driven convergence share one eligibility check, flow and
drop-cap context builder, retained-suffix publisher, and font-resolution input; their stopping rules remain explicit because
an edit follows prior line slots while a dirty exclusion must cross its future block horizon. Drop-cap paragraphs use the same
path: the core rederives the cap from current
run geometry, reapplies its cut while recomposing the dirty band, realigns baseline-aligned caps from the retained or new
first body line, and accepts the suffix only when it matches the cold authority. The remaining projected-object and
drop-cap matrix belongs to
[Milestone 12's fragment-relative reflow plan](../planning/fragment-relative-reflow.md); balanced columns remain deferred.

The Three subpath exposes `projectTextFlowBounds` and `projectTextFlowSilhouette` for projected-object flow. The bounds
helper computes the exact convex intersection of a conservative transformed `Box3` with the camera-side text-plane and
camera-frustum half-spaces. The silhouette helper accepts an ordered finite object-local `Vector3` ring, clips its edges
through the same half-spaces, and preserves a validated simple concavity when projection inflation is zero. Both helpers
ray-project their surviving geometry onto paragraph-local inline/block coordinates, clip and f32-normalize the result,
and return an ordinary keyed `TextFlowExclusion`; declared projection error conservatively expands the result through a
convex hull. Geometry wholly behind the text plane produces no exclusion. Neither helper reads depth/GPU pixels nor
claims hidden-surface or material-coverage exactness.

The shared paragraph layout surface also admits a same-source `dropCap` with a bounded line span, cap-height text-top or
baseline alignment, logical side, inline/block margins, and an optional caller-authored simple contour normalized over
the generated cap exclusion box. Text-top alignment uses the shaping face's retained OpenType `sCapHeight` against the
surrounding stack's first available font and synthesizes `.66em` when the metric is absent; line-box leading therefore
does not lift the initial above the body cap line. Rust selects the first complete extended grapheme and extends through
the first shaping-safe cluster edge within the bounded search; when no safe edge exists it disables the cap rather than
splitting shaped content. The selected prefix keeps its authored shaping/style/raster data, is positioned by the same
glyph authority as the body, and becomes an additional conservative glyph/design-bounds cut before body composition.
Body flow resumes at the exact retained cluster edge, while measurement, inspection, and Three realization merge the cap
into the first logical line without duplicating source glyphs. Focused evidence covers a combining-mark cap, RTL logical
side mapping, safe-edge refusal, an explicit multi-line region with another exclusion, and incremental exclusion movement
matching a cold rebuild for both text-top and baseline alignment. Same-length edits inside the cap source now rederive
the cap, recompose through every cap-affected band, and retain the exact cold-equivalent suffix once the line state
converges. When a contour is present, Rust intersects it with each body-line band and conservatively reduces the result
to the logical-side inline cut while preserving cap placement and source ownership. The refreshed live Editorial contour
matrix passes all twelve raster/backend/shader cells with three retained draws; the complete caret/selection interaction
matrix remains Milestone 12.4 work.

## Renderer Codec

Each portable raster format registers a schema, Codec-body factory, and cold font compiler through the root package. Three
registers only the renderer half—resource realization and material creation—then assembles the complete Three Codec
program from the portable body. Rust validates and interprets the compiled Codec; it never invokes a JavaScript callback in
shaping, layout, or packing. Cold resource selection receives explicit `(glyphIndex, strikeIndex)` coordinates; the
compiler alone lowers them into the strike-major wire table. Three validates declared reserved supplied-geometry
semantics when a variant registers, then validates every retained payload attribute when a font is bound, before device
realization. Material contexts retain the discriminated `PortableResource` union rather than erasing typed payloads
to `unknown`.

CPU reference renderers and allocation diagnostics may pair `compileRasterFont()` with `readCompiledRasterFont()`.
The authenticated read-only view resolves schema field names, strike rows, selected resources, and portable payloads
directly from the compiled binding. It does not expose raster-format-private decoded font data, perform another raster
decode, or copy the binding's scalar value tables; ordinary renderers continue through their bound command-buffer view.

Portable resource declarations select `one` or `many` cardinality. Fixed-member groups carry synchronized leaf buffers
and textures under one retained identity; groups cannot nest, geometry cannot repeat, and every resourceful schema names
the primary render resource used by the command-buffer primitive. Bitmap repeated strikes, MSDF atlas/range companions, and Slug
repeated page groups all compile through this contract. Capability profiles contain capabilities only;
`compileCodec()` assigns their nonzero wire IDs by descriptor order, and ordinary single-profile frames omit the
selector.

`RasterResourceId` is the authoritative identity of one renderer resource realization. Reusing an ID means the format,
schema role, companion set, metadata, and bytes are unchanged; a Codec must mint a new ID when any of those change. The
handle retains and reference-counts the first payload under that ID without rescanning immutable bytes. Distinct authored
strings that collide after compact wire hashing are rejected once by the handle's `CodecIdScope` before retention.

Codec-authored wire identities are hashed domain/name pairs returned as branded numbers. Module-level Codec and buffer
constants use `id(kind, stableName)`. Handle construction supplies collision-checked identities to `encode()` and keeps
their provenance private. Invalid names or observed collisions throw at the authoring call. Buffer IDs are folded into
the nonzero `u16` ABI range; registration and Codec compilation still reject conflicts. Dense renderer slots such as
`transformIndex` remain explicit compact indices rather than application identities.

The first-party Codec can select indexed transform batching, direct per-draw transforms, or a hybrid. Indexed mode adds a
stable transform-table ID to each rendered glyph so compatible paragraphs may collapse into one draw. Direct mode splits
draws by transform for integrations that prefer ordinary object matrices. Physical glyph records use direct logical order;
the pre-alpha stable-indirect allocation experiment and its renderer order buffer are retired under D-362. Stable glyph
identity and placement generations remain independent CPU authorities. A paragraph always batches its own spans, so no
root policy states draw order.

`materialId` is explicit through the frame ABI and command buffer. Three maps it to a `defineTextMaterial()` factory. Material
identity may split draws without forcing a second copy of the canonical glyph buffers.

MSDF material shaders publish `fillDistance`, `trueDistance`, and `pixelRange` alongside their coverage outputs (D-365).
Both Three configurations use the same `TslMsdfShaderOutput` type; raw TypeGPU `msdfFragment()` and
`msdfRenderDetailed()` return the corresponding numeric fields. The private TypeGPU reconstruction supplies one set of
distances to coverage and custom effects. `msdfCoverage()` retains its coverage-vector return contract. The
[material reference](../planning/three-api.md#msdf-distance-fields) defines units, sign, and effect limits.

Bitmap atlas pages within one strike are renderer layers, not independent draw resources. The font binding exposes one
strike resource, the Rust Codec program writes the selected page as one u32 instance lane, and Three uploads the strike as one
R8 texture array. This preserves authored glyph order while preventing page transitions inside ordinary prose from
splitting a paragraph into hundreds of draws. The multi-page integration fixture asserts one ordered draw and a live
Chrome run reduced the sampled Paragraph Stress CPU frame from roughly 80 ms before the correction to 0.47–1.3 ms after
it; the sampled GPU frame remained a separate 1–5 ms concern.

## Font fallback and raster formats

`createFontStack()` accepts fonts from one runtime in explicit fallback order. Members may use different raster formats.
The font carries both shaping identity and raster binding, so `Text` has no redundant format property. Rust resolves the
font for each cluster and partitions the command buffer according to the active renderer's supported Codec programs.

This permits an MSDF or Bitmap prose font to fall back to a Slug emoji font while keeping third-party renderers safe: an
unregistered raster format fails at the Codec boundary instead of producing an unsupported draw.
A public compiled-Wasm integration loads Bitmap Inter plus Slug Font Awesome, shapes one paragraph through that ordered
fallback stack, and observes two Rust-planned draws with exact Bitmap `vec2` and Slug `vec4` physical records. The
selected font binding—not a `Text` format selector—carries the renderer program and resource.

Raster formats explicitly declare the text effects their portable Codec and shader implement. MSDF supports outline and
shadow; Bitmap and Slug currently support neither. Three and root-configured integrations validate
the selected font formats at the call that accepts a style, so an unsupported effect cannot become a malformed or
silently degraded command buffer. The semantic ABI carries effect color, width, offset, and inherited opacity only for
raster programs that opt in.

## Semantic queries

Publication emits no semantic readback by default. A renderer that needs current local bounds requests the measurement
sidecar on the same update; core copies it into the retained text cache before target acceptance, so plan publication and
bounds cost one Wasm hop. Every semantic mutation invalidates that cache immediately. `Text.measure()` then answers from
the cache or explicitly measures current desired state, while `Text.glyphs()` similarly requests the positioned
inspection lane. `Text.withGlyphs()` prepares that same state without emitting the full inspection table and copies only
explicitly indexed records. None of these queries traverses matrices, realizes renderer resources, flips publication
slots, or burns a revision.

A same-build isolation over one 21,805-glyph paragraph measured 0.002 ms for an unchanged publication, 0.174 ms for the
aggregate measurement sidecar, and 0.582 ms for full glyph inspection. Three requests only aggregate measurement and
only while it has changed text to publish; an idle synchronization does not enter the engine. Default renderer-neutral
publication therefore pays no semantic-sidecar cost, while renderers that need same-frame bounds pay the explicit
per-publication cost instead of making a second Wasm query.

An explicit query before first render carries the complete desired paragraph lifecycle and applies text, style, and
geometry mutations only for the queried paragraph. It serializes paragraph-order rows only for nonremoved paragraphs
whose scoped rank is still pending publication; a semantic-only query therefore does not resend stable ranks, while
sequential queries preserve every rank in the pending transaction. Sequential queries extend one speculative batch
candidate. The next ordinary publication adopts matching prepared work and publishes the batch once instead of shaping
twice; a geometry-only mismatch reuses the semantic prefix and recomputes only flow and positioning. Unchanged
measurements and inspections remain cached until the next semantic mutation.

The engine additionally exports `pmndrs_glyph_engine_measure_paragraph`, a paragraph-scoped synchronous query beside
`pmndrs_glyph_engine_update`. It reuses the update request layout with the queried paragraph as an ABI argument, runs
validation and speculative preparation for that paragraph only, and writes the header plus semantic table into the
borrowed result arena without publishing: no publication-generation bump, no revision advance, and no
renderer-fence acknowledgment. The host must copy the records out before its next update call (host lease). The query
terminates leave-committed, so the following ordinary frame proceeds from pre-measure revisions with no checkpoint
hazard.

The prepared pending state is retained as one speculative render-planner transaction. Sequential queries extend it while the
committed revision, lifecycle input, and the queried paragraph's text/style input fingerprints still match — a
geometry-only follow-up query re-runs just geometry, flow, and positioning over the retained semantic prefix, and
identities extend linearly from the transaction's high-water marks instead of rolling back between queries. Any
fingerprint mismatch rebuilds cold with results identical to a fresh preparation.

The committing frame adopts the transaction instead of discarding it: when the frame's lifecycle input matches, its
identity counters continue from the transaction's reserved high-water marks, and each paragraph whose text/style/geometry
inputs fingerprint-match its speculative pending state skips preparation entirely — the stable glyph identities a query
reported stay valid in the committed frame. A paragraph whose prefix matches but whose geometry changed re-runs only the
geometry/flow/positioning tail; anything else prepares cold. A frame whose inputs do not match the transaction drops it
leave-committed at entry, so committed state never observes an unadopted query.

The semantic values preserve information useful to callers:

- resolved box dimensions remain distinct from intrinsic content extents;
- clipping does not discard off-viewport semantic layout;
- semantic truncation retains visible positioned lines while reporting intrinsic overflow;
- glyph/font identity, UTF-16 clusters, stable IDs, flags, line membership, and positioned origins remain available on
  explicit inspection;
- detached copy requests never mutate authoritative Rust layout or the source planner's acceptance frontier.

## Root-assisted detached glyph copies

Public `Text.breakApart()` requests committed glyph and decoration subsets through its owning root. Rust compacts the
selected paragraph records through the installed Codec into complete checkpoints; it does not expose buffer offsets or
private planning objects for each renderer to reconstruct. Root services synchronously decode each detached copy into its
destination renderer. The query does not advance the source root's revision or publication generation.

Three's `Text.breakApart()` uses both planner requests and returns the frozen tuple
`[Glyphs, Decorations | undefined]`. It preserves the source transform, Codec-defined batching, fallback raster formats,
shared immutable atlas/page leases, and supplied geometry while adding one full affine matrix per drawable record. Its
local methods mirror `InstancedMesh`; world methods bridge physics state to root-relative storage. Bulk world-space
callers update the detached root once, invert its world matrix once, convert each body matrix with
`worldToLocalMatrix()`, and use `setMatrixAt()` so traversal and inversion stay outside the per-glyph loop. Materials and
root-relative resource leases belong to each detached object,
so the pair may outlive the source `Text`, font, and loader without sharing mutable presentation state. The source `Text`
stays live and may continue publishing while detached objects remain unchanged.

Decoration passes are not glyph records and retain an independent object and lifetime; tuple slot two is `undefined`
when the committed paragraph has no decoration draws. Three coordinates both roots' draw ranges so underline/overline
remain below glyphs and line-through remains above them without assigning a group-level render order. If either import
fails, `breakApart()` releases everything it created before throwing. Neither path reconstructs child `Text` objects,
installs mutable presentation overrides, creates physics bodies, or infers collision shapes. The detailed ownership and
evidence contract is in
[Planner-assisted detached glyph slices](../planning/detached-glyph-slice.md).

## Wasm memory and copying

The host pins request/result staging views and re-pins after any `memory.grow()`, because growth detaches existing views.
Growth is permitted only at the `pmndrs_glyph_engine_update` boundary. Result capacity is negotiated and retried without publishing a
partial revision.

Batch and paragraph capacities are intentionally separate. Request/result arenas scale with aggregate `TextGroup`
content, while Rust line and text scratch are bounded by the longest paragraph. Feeding aggregate text length into the
per-paragraph line bound multiplied retained scratch by paragraph count: a 684-paragraph recycling regression grew Wasm
memory from roughly 2.07 GB to the 4.29 GB address ceiling in 17 updates. The corrected bound completes 200 update cycles
and settles near 105 MB for that deliberately larger 8,000-glyph fixture. This regression also guards against forwarding
aggregate glyph capacity as one paragraph's text reservation.

The configured-root text prewarm is 64 UTF-16 units and applies to one reusable spare paragraph, not every retained Text.
Active paragraph lanes grow from their actual content and retain their high-water capacity; publication therefore does
not rescan every Text or attempt to resize an already-consumed spare. A 100-root cold probe measured 224.00 KiB per root
at 64 units versus 686.08 KiB at the former 256-unit default, excluding the equal command buffers. The smaller default
keeps more than four times the observed 9–14-unit label headroom while preserving unbounded correctness through ordinary
arena growth.

Retained publication tracks lifecycle, text, style, and geometry invalidation independently. The shared configured Text
controller derives partial updates from each adapter's complete desired state; adapters and renderers do not implement
wire diffing. The shared controller retains the accepted caller identities beside cycle-safe, deeply frozen style,
layout, and constraint snapshots. Reusing the same readonly outer record is an O(1) unchanged signal; supplying a new
outer record compares it with the accepted snapshot and clones only a material change. A nested edit submitted through a
new outer style, layout, or constraint record therefore cannot rewrite history or disappear through `/typegpu` or a
custom `GlyphConfig`. Three's retained authoring model uses the same snapshot utility, and its package-owned records cross
the controller seam without a second clone. A plain string replacement reuses its normalized font, transform, material,
style, layout, and constraint ownership. When those accepted input identities return through a content-only update,
normalization skips recursive comparison and cloning; a new outer property record still takes the validating path.
Equal-length content emits only the minimal scalar-aligned text record; length changes additionally republish
root-style coverage. A font-size or paint-only update emits only its style record while Rust remains authoritative for
shaping and layout invalidation. These cases do not republish paragraph membership, scoped order, constraints, regions,
exclusions, or inline-object records; assigning an already-plain string to itself does not advance desired state or cross
the Wasm boundary. Pending style-limit accounting follows the same style-dirty predicate as wire emission. Rust limits
implicit paragraph inference to an empty planner, so a content batch may address several existing paragraphs without
dummy lifecycle upserts. Rust indexes each populated semantic input table by paragraph ID before visiting retained
semantic order, so valid atomic content batches do not depend on the adapter's Set insertion order. The reusable compact
span index is empty on ordinary clean frames and retains its capacity after the first populated batch; glyph, cluster,
and plan record layouts remain unchanged. An omitted authored `maxLines` is encoded with Rust's existing zero sentinel for the root limit,
so ordinary geometry no longer depends on string length. In the 684-label workload this reduces the request from 209,448
to 23,400 bytes and the fresh
same-machine remote-main A/B from 24.24–25.87 ms to final post-review medians of 11.39–11.89 ms while retaining one draw
and 5,362 glyphs.

Bitmap vertex pixel snapping is an explicit immutable Three/R3F option and defaults off. The unsnapped graph uses the
ordinary model-view-projection position so shared-root or camera animation preserves subpixel movement; callers targeting
a pixel-art presentation can opt in without changing shaping, layout, or render-plan records.

WebGPU may alias compatible Wasm-backed typed arrays. Three's WebGL2 PBO path owns a padded array and therefore requires
one retained copy. The architecture does not add complexity to pretend WebGL2 can preserve a Wasm alias it replaces.

Each raster baker's Rust contract generator emits both published JSON and an exact typed TypeScript constant. Bitmap,
MTSDF, and Slug may own different internal ABI shapes—MTSDF exposes both its glyph generator and artifact baker—but their
TypeScript hosts consume those generated constants directly and validate the declared exports once during construction.
There are no instance-ignoring runtime ABI readers. Package builds isolate the distributable MTSDF and Slug
`artifact-baker` feature sets from kernel-only test targets and reject an optimized module missing any contract-declared
artifact export, preventing Cargo's shared top-level artifact path from silently publishing a smaller test variant.

Renderer-facing types that applications can encounter publish from root `@pmndrs/glyph`, including `GlyphConfig`,
`CommandBufferView`/`DisplayList`, constrained root services, and `GlyphRenderer.decode`. Runtime construction helpers
such as `defineGlyphConfig`, Codec authoring, schema binding, raster-format definition, and resource leases live on
`@pmndrs/glyph/core`. D-306 and D-308 retired D-249's engine-driving layer; the current `/core` contains only the integration construction contract. Internal projection,
identity mapping, planning, settlement, and Wasm transport are package machinery rather than an application or integrator
API. The explicit `/shaders/tsl` and `/shaders/typegpu` subpaths own raster-format shader realizations and no scene, runtime, or root.

The raw borrowed Rust publication and its typed command tree never cross the integration boundary. The engine projects
that trusted wire data through the integration's schema and resource resolver, then calls
`GlyphRenderer.decode(CommandBufferView)`. The bound view is the only renderer input: it preserves authoritative ordered
display-list children and exposes the closed semantic `GlyphInstanceKind` union, while numeric wire identities,
projection state, and publication settlement remain private. An integration therefore implements one host-realization
step rather than selecting or invoking a second decoder.

Codec authoring similarly exposes only the identity vocabulary an integration can legitimately declare:
`id.buffer`, `id.technique`, `id.program`, and `id.resource`. Numeric identities for installed Codecs, font bindings,
root publications, paragraphs, styles, materials, regions, exclusions, inline objects, and live resources are minted and
validated by package-owned handle state. Their scopes and the capability-set wire selection are unavailable from
`/core`, so a custom renderer cannot accidentally become a second engine-state owner.

Three and `packages/glyph-example-renderer` consume the same public root types and `/core` helpers available to third-party integrations. The
example is the standing second-engine proof: its Codec describes storage, the trusted internal projection supplies one
borrowed ordered view, its renderer stages and commits host objects synchronously, exact identities govern retirement,
and its caller-owned TypeGPU/WebGPU host later submits work. Portable font compilation retains only validated buffer,
texture, grouped-resource, and GLB-like geometry payloads, never renderer objects.

The same reasoning withdrew the `*-abi` and `bakers/*/validate` subpaths. Raw struct offsets and enum numbers remain
package-private implementation data; applications receive semantic values at root and integrations author Codecs through `/core`.
The validator subpaths likewise had no consumer outside this package. Both sets of modules remain reachable by relative
path from package-owned tests and scripts where wire-level verification is legitimate.

The 0.1.0 surface has 14 explicit ESM entry points and 149 distinct runtime export names, down from 40 and 239. There are no positive wildcard exports: adding a source file never
publishes it. Renderer construction shares `/core`, portable format values and their options/data types live at the root, and React components and hooks share `/react`; Three helpers have one home on `/three`.
Shader composition uses one entry per backend, `/shaders/tsl` and `/shaders/typegpu`, with complete stages, their input
schemas, and resource slots/accessors. TypeGPU also retains MSDF coverage/compositing and Slug dilation for custom
materials. Polynomial solvers, band addressing, texel loaders, CPU references, and Three bridge shaders stay private.

The root retains the built-in format objects and public options/data types. `/core` retains their schemas, codecs,
and the few constants/helpers needed to interpret decoded data in custom integrations. Format metadata and descriptor construction are available on the format object. Baker factories remain public;
raw generated ABI objects, validator implementation steps, Worker routing tables, preprojection identities, and legacy
manual-register assembly do not. Explicit config barrels separate supported construction from host-only program
assembly, resource normalization, and schema authentication. The existing packed consumer tests import every supported entry and prove retired paths are inaccessible.

Configured rendering has one publication contract: `glyph.shape()` stages every dirty root, crosses the Wasm boundary
once, and synchronously offers each root's borrowed command-buffer view to its renderer. `CommandBufferView.revision`
is the monotonic revision of that root's Codec-produced command state; `engineRevision` independently identifies the
engine transaction that produced it. The view expires when decode
returns; renderer commit/discard settles the corresponding publication before the batch closes. The removed owned-target
branch copied every publication, resolved a second payload manifest, awaited a separate target, and pooled returned buffers, but
no GlyphConfig integration could use it and it could not participate in the engine-wide shape batch. Cross-realm font
movement remains the explicit lazy `FontFace.clone()` operation; render-plan transfer is not a parallel publication API.
The former direct planner/transport update path is also gone: it had no production caller and would have restored one
Wasm crossing per root beside the staged batch. The example renderer proves TypeGPU and WebGPU realization directly
against the same borrowed Rust command buffer.

## Current correctness evidence

The foundation currently has:

- 237 passing Rust engine tests, including exact retained-cluster, revision-range, immediate line-convergence, and
  later cursor-convergence regressions;
- the package JavaScript/integration gate passing through the single-path public exports;
- exact retained Amiri bidi, policy, ellipsis, clipping, UIKit-layout, and CJK contracts exercised by the browser
  `paragraph-contracts` target through the shared Glyph font graph, public `Text`, `TextGroup`, `measure()`, and `glyphs()`;
- 32/32 pixel-exact public Bitmap WebGL2 frames against the independent CPU oracle, including resize and clipping, with
  zero differing channel bytes and pinned SHA-256 `a47930d3…15e893`;
- source-font SHA-256, registered shaping hashes, and HarfRust/HarfBuzz oracle identities authenticated independently of
  the browser behavior check;
- byte-identical Bitmap, MSDF, and Slug packing/consumer gates retained elsewhere in the benchmark suite;
- a sequence-level property gate (`engine-sequence-property.test.mjs`) driving randomized-but-seeded interactive
  sequences through the public Three surface — text edits, resizes, metric and paint restyles, direction, language and
  feature flips, font swaps, and lifecycle churn, with measure queries interleaved so speculative transactions are opened
  and then adopted or dropped — asserting per step that valid input publishes, that a repeated measurement agrees with
  itself, and that the per-glyph inspection lane and the line-level measurement lane report the same glyph and line
  totals. Determinism is part of the contract: a fixed seed list, no wall clock, no retry, and a failure names the seed
  and operation journal that reproduce it. Reverting the three status-6 fixes (D-255) turns it red at seed 1;
- React paragraph lease accounting under StrictMode and react-three-fiber's idle-deferred disposal, with a positive
  control proving a lease is genuinely held so the silence in the other cases is not vacuous;
- total teardown: repeated group and runtime disposal neither throws nor leaves a font half-disposed, and teardown in the
  wrong order — runtime first, paragraphs after — completes, which is the ordering r3f actually produces.

The browser paragraph target is fully green under the explicit f32 frame contract. The former UIKit mismatch came from a
fixture generated by the deleted TypeScript path, where authored JavaScript-double line height survived until final array
publication. The retained engine deliberately receives that style scalar as f32, accumulates line positions in f64, and
narrows published values once. An independent calculation from the f32 line box reproduces the corrected final baseline,
centered glyph row, content height, and complete layout hash exactly; no runtime precision or tolerance changed.

### MTSDF reference correction and remaining pinch artifacts (issue #145)

The original 63-versus-32 Inter `8` comparison was not a comparison of equivalent edge lists. `ShapePen` always
emitted `#` at contour closure, which tells msdfgen to add a straight closing edge even when Fontations had already
returned to the start. That gave native 44 edges versus Glyph's 41. The three zero-length edges changed corner
detection and coloring. The non-shipping serializer now adds only missing closing edges, with focused tests for
explicit curve/line closure and implicit closure across contours. The native request also carries the CFF contour
reversal applied by `OutlineSource::emit`; omitting it caused the earlier Dancing Script sign failures in
no-scanline experiments. These corrections supersede the earlier native counts and coloring conclusions.[^mtsdf-reference-shape]

With corrected input, both Simple-coloring implementations reconstruct Inter `8` with 63 samples whose absolute
coverage error exceeds 0.25, at 64 px/em, range 8, and 8× magnification. Their reconstruction images are byte-identical.
Its waist artifact is shared by native Simple coloring. The corrected comparison gives:[^mtsdf-quality-inspection]

| Sample             | Glyph | Native Simple | Native Distance | Native InkTrap |
| ------------------ | ----: | ------------: | --------------: | -------------: |
| Inter `8`          |    63 |            63 |              20 |             20 |
| Inter `4`          |    25 |            25 |              25 |             25 |
| Inter `&`          |     3 |             3 |               3 |              3 |
| Source Serif `g`   |    32 |            23 |              20 |             23 |
| Dancing Script `w` |   193 |           193 |             197 |            197 |
| Dancing Script `g` |   201 |           199 |             199 |            194 |

The corrected 26-case corpus totals are 956 for Glyph, 1,032 for native Simple, 988 for native Distance, and 989
for native InkTrap. The 63-to-20 improvement is a measured coloring opportunity, with tradeoffs: both alternatives
regress Dancing Script `w` by four samples and `M` by one. These are native experiments, not a production coloring
change. The CLI's default scanline path disables geometric distance checks; correctly oriented Inter, Source Serif,
and Dancing Script samples have equal auto-fast and auto-mixed counts in this corpus.[^msdfgen-cli]

Separate diagnostic experiments identified two remaining baker differences. Increasing curve-winding subdivision
from 16/24 to 1,024 removed a one-texel inside/outside classification error in Source Serif `g`, changing 32 error
samples to 27. Allowing inversion correction on protected texels changed Dancing Script `g` from 201 to 199;
combined with denser winding, Source Serif `g` reached 23. These outputs matched native reconstruction.
These are investigation findings for future fixes; the temporary instrumentation is not retained, and 1,024
subdivisions are not an accepted production implementation.

Run `mise exec cmake@4.4.3 -- pnpm scripts run glyph:mtsdf-quality:inspect -- --all` for the complete corpus,
or omit `--all` for the reported Inter/Dancing Script samples. Optional `--font <fixture-relative path> --chars <text>`
selects another sample. The workflow writes measurements, PPM comparisons, and a self-contained HTML report under
ignored `packages/glyph/.cache/mtsdf-quality-inspect`. Chrome screenshots display CPU reconstructions, not GPU-renderer
verification. Once the native oracle is provisioned, ordinary `mise exec -- pnpm scripts run ...` suffices.

`mise exec -- pnpm scripts run glyph:mtsdf-quality:check` runs the closure regression tests and existing production
quality checks. This change fixes the reference comparison; production kernels, shaders, goldens, and baked assets
are unchanged.

[^mtsdf-quality-inspection]: Package-owned native variant inspection workflow and generated measurements.

[^mtsdf-reference-shape]: The reference outline serializer, its closure regressions, and the independent CPU reconstruction.

[^msdfgen-cli]: msdfgen 1.13 `main.cpp`, scanline defaults and post-generation error-correction configuration.

## Legacy-path and duplication audit

The Rust command buffer is the only glyph-packing implementation. Rust is also the production authority for Unicode
analysis: the generator emits the compact Script/Script_Extensions and line-break tables consumed by the shaper, and
the full TypeScript paragraph analyzer has been retired. The JavaScript `findGraphemeBoundaries` helper remains a real
runtime dependency while authored rich-text spans are normalized synchronously before the shape boundary; its complete
Unicode 17 GraphemeBreakTest gate is retained beside an independent gate over Rust's analysis. Mutation tests keep a
test-only line-break oracle so their expected topology is not derived from the engine under test.

The former TypeScript `RasterRuntime`, raster
candidate/commit transaction, `select`, `createStorage`, and `writeStorage` surfaces are deleted from production source
and public exports. Current raster formats own identity, artifact decoding, retained CPU resource data, and disposal;
Rust Codec programs own instance packing and dirty-range publication. The package gate retains production render-plan,
font-binding, Three execution, artifact-validation, and Unicode conformance coverage instead of test-only TypeScript
packers.

Publication layout is computed once at the Wasm boundary, checked against the caller's output limit, and passed unchanged
to the encoder. The encoder writes that package-owned layout directly; it does not rescan the immutable plan to recreate
or revalidate the same offsets before publication. Rust transport tests pin every emitted table offset, count, and payload
range against the compiler-owned plan. The complete record-relationship oracle is compiled only for tests and explicitly
instrumented builds, and runs over real ordered, stable, and mixed planner outputs; release publication retains only
checked size arithmetic and destination bounds.

The TypeScript request compiler likewise owns one checked, monotonic allocation stream for fixed tables and variable
payloads. Its product test pins every table, text, language, feature, and polygon range as disjoint and in bounds. Rust
therefore borrows each individual slice with checked offset, count, alignment, and work limits, but does not compare those
immutable slices pairwise or quadratically after the package has constructed them. Maintainers can build a deliberately
instrumented shaper with Cargo feature `debug-validation`; tests enable the publication oracle automatically, while the
shipping `--release --no-default-features` Wasm build does not contain it.

Global shaping snapshots dirty roots from the engine-owned participant set and writes every root descriptor exactly once.
The public multi-handle product test captures those real Wasm descriptors and pins unique, stable root identities across
updates. Rust therefore bounds the owned batch arena and processes its entries directly; it does not allocate a second root
array, sort it, or scan for duplicates before every global shape.

The retained planner likewise mints one nonzero paragraph identity per Text and emits each paragraph once in scene order.
The public two-Text and replacement Three integrations capture actual Wasm requests and pin identity, order, opcodes,
zeroed reserved fields, and the canonical zero order for removals. Rust checks the paragraph table's range and alignment,
then decodes each opcode where the mutation is consumed; it does not pre-scan compiler-owned record canonicality or search
earlier records for duplicate package-owned identities or orders.

That same public request proves one constraint per paragraph and a distinct nonzero flow-thread identity for each. The
request reader therefore trusts those planner-owned identities instead of rescanning the constraint table; caller-authored
axis, typography, wrapping, overflow, and work-limit values remain checked where they enter the Rust engine.

Every ordinary constraint also produces a distinct nonzero region identity bound to a live nonzero transform identity.
The same captured request proves that producer contract. Rust consumes those identities directly instead of searching the
region table for duplicates or rechecking package-minted zero sentinels; it retains caller-authored geometry and raw-memory
checks.

Constraint region spans are also compiler-owned: every paragraph receives one nonempty contiguous partition, including
multi-column layouts, and starts with no resume region. The public producer proof covers one ordinary and one two-column
Text in the same request. Rust no longer pre-scans those relationships before the flow arena consumes the already-bounded
region table.

A Mori 0.19.1 production-source scan (review profile, same-language threshold 0.85, minimum 40 tokens) first identified
shared machinery across the former ordered and stable planners. The narrower extraction saved 1,188 raw / 328 gzip / 744
Brotli bytes, but retained two physical-storage engines. D-362 later retired the unused stable-indirect experiment in full;
the decision register and append-only log retain its design and benchmark history.

## Current size and performance evidence

The checked package-size record after public-export simplification reports:

| Graph                                   |         Raw |      gzip |    Brotli |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------: | --------: | --------: |
| Core JavaScript plus shaper Wasm        | 1,637,744 B | 591,387 B | 464,596 B |
| Three adapter plus core and shaper Wasm | 1,831,432 B | 639,269 B | 503,332 B |

Optional peers are excluded. Raw counts use readable JavaScript plus optimized Wasm; compressed counts use minified
JavaScript and optimized Wasm compressed independently, as browsers transfer them as separate assets. The distribution
keeps source-shaped declarations and private maintenance emit, with tsdown producing compact ESM and retaining tree-shaking annotations in TypeGPU shader modules. Explicit
package exports remain authoritative for source/type/import conditions and Wasm assets.

### Bidi class lookup: two-stage trie (D-341)

`bidi_class` is called once per character on every analysis. It searched 1,267
`(u32, u32, BidiClass)` tuples, which pad to 12 bytes, so each of roughly eleven probes strided
three cache lines. It now indexes a two-stage code-point trie — an 8,704-entry stage-1 index over
184 deduplicated 128-code-point blocks — in two array reads.

Both implementations compiled into one binary and run over identical inputs, best of nine:

| corpus       | binary search | trie    |      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------- | ---- |
| latin        | 6.59 ns       | 1.18 ns | 5.6x |
| cjk          | 6.78 ns       | 1.17 ns | 5.8x |
| mixed script | 7.32 ns       | 1.22 ns | 6.0x |

Artifact effect, same-session A/B on `main` with identical source, flags, and `wasm-opt` pipeline:
1,191,281 -> 1,209,532 raw (+18,251), 460,939 -> 459,414 gzip (-1,526), 363,430 -> 362,789 Brotli
(-641). Smaller over the wire under both encodings. An earlier reading of +5,399 Brotli is
withdrawn: it compared against a build of a different branch rather than a same-session baseline,
and isolated table compression was found to be a poor predictor of marginal cost inside a 1.2 MB
module. The growth is confined to the data section (220,350 -> 237,110) while the code section
shrinks (966,819 -> 963,087) because the search loop is gone.

Cold start is unchanged. Compile and instantiate medians are indistinguishable across four
repeated and order-reversed runs of 60 samples: compile minima cluster at 0.134-0.149 ms for both
artifacts, and instantiate holds at ~0.06 ms despite 16,760 additional data bytes, because data
segments are memcpy'd into linear memory rather than validated and compiled. An initial single run
suggested an 18% compile improvement; repetition showed the sign flips with run order, so the
honest reading is flat.

End-to-end this is worth about 0.8% of `text_update` on a 22k-glyph paragraph, below that
benchmark's noise floor, because bidi lookup is roughly one percent of a shaping-dominated
pipeline. The per-lookup figure is the claim.

`line_break::properties` (18.56 ns -> 1.32 ns, 14.1x) and `unicode::script` (15.78 -> 1.32, 11.9x)
now use the same structure through the shared `scripts/support/code-point-trie.mjs` helper, which
also replaced the bidi generator's hand-written copy. Across all three tables the artifact moves
1,191,281 -> 1,258,319 raw (+67,038), 460,939 -> 453,053 gzip (-7,886), 363,430 -> 357,253 Brotli
(-6,177) — smaller over the wire under both encodings, and roughly five times the saving bidi gave
alone.

`SCRIPT_EXTENSION_END_VALUES` stays on the range search: its 284 distinct values overflow a u8
stage-2 index and need a wider table. `SCRIPT_EXTENSION_OFFSETS` is excluded permanently because it
is already directly indexed and has no search to remove.

A same-host comparison against the original pre-cleanup build covers the export reduction, root format move, and core naming.
Browser core moves from 85,612 to 85,829 B under gzip; Three moves from 133,725 to 133,711 B;
direct TypeGPU moves from 44,014 to 42,011 B; the experimental Three/TypeGPU graph moves from
146,959 to 143,885 B. Every measured Wasm artifact is byte-identical before and after. All raw, minified,
gzip, and Brotli measurements remain within the unchanged size ceilings. The core fixture selects core API names
explicitly so raster runtimes remain independently measured even though formats now share the root entry.

The earlier shared-entry checks proved that selecting one React format hook excludes the other hooks; React's shared default Three runtime already includes all three formats before consolidation. Root format selection and `/core` are checked directly against implementation imports and the preceding package build. The focused cases cover `glyphFlags`, `txt`, `glyph`, each built-in format, `defineGlyphConfig`, and `msdfSchema`. All eight cases retain identical implementation module and emitted asset sets before and after the move. Renaming the construction entry from `/extend` to `/core` preserves those module and asset sets; compressed byte counts vary slightly with emitted identifiers and URLs. `glyph`, `txt`, and `glyphFlags` retain no raster format, and each selected format excludes the other two formats and their decoders. Identifier ordering changes compressed byte counts without adding implementation modules.

Single-function imports from `/shaders/typegpu` now prune unused stages within the selected technique, including Bitmap vertex versus fragment, MSDF vertex versus coverage, and Slug dilation versus rendering. TypeGPU metadata registrations and module-level constructors carry PURE annotations, and the shader-only build preserves them. The resulting Bitmap vertex, Bitmap fragment, and MSDF vertex consumer bundles also resolve successfully to WGSL. Other modules retain compact publication output. The shared `/shaders/tsl` entry also excludes unused techniques. The existing size workflow checks initial-versus-lazy module membership, and the registration smoke test proves required raster registration survives consumer tree shaking.

WebGPU continues to alias canonical plan arrays directly. Three's WebGL2 PBO builder replaces a storage attribute's
array with power-of-two-padded retained texture storage, so later Rust patches copy only their dirty byte ranges into
that detached upload view before invalidating its texture. A focused integration fixture simulates the replacement and
proves exact canonical/upload equality with untouched padding. The complete 48-cell presentation matrix keeps every
Bitmap, MTSDF, and Slug workload visible on WebGPU and forced WebGL2; this is the deliberate one-copy WebGL2 fallback,
not another renderer-side layout or packing path.
The corrected complete MTSDF baker is 556,619 raw / 218,279 gzip / 171,376 Brotli bytes. A fresh isolated build of the
zero-import feature-minimal admission module is 69,736 optimized / 30,418 gzip / 25,717 Brotli bytes; release evidence
reads that fresh-build record rather than the superseded SIMD-experiment snapshot.
Correcting channel selection changes pixel identities without changing atlas dimensions or GPU residency, but the new
channel data is less compressible: canonical Inter moves from 6,798,458 to 8,007,071 gzip bytes and Font Awesome from
7,227,921 to 8,705,885. These are baked-asset transfer costs, not default package or per-frame renderer costs.

The public Three benchmark now supports an outside-only mode that leaves the internal phase collector disabled and wraps
one `updateMatrixWorld()` call with a host timer. An eight-warmup/31-sample run over 25,515 positioned glyphs measured
19.42/6.59/3.10/14.24 ms median and 21.00/6.86/4.75/15.26 ms p95 for cold/font-size/width/text updates. Those values cover
frame preparation, the complete Rust transaction and render-plan publication, and Three plan application; they exclude
GPU submission. An adjacent phase-instrumented run was indistinguishable within process noise. Those temporary profiler
exports, calls, branches, and clock reads are now absent from the package source and clean publishing output; benchmark
workload markers and the direct Wasm timer remain outside the shipped library.

After the final plan-application lifecycle audit, Three sizes indexed transforms from live paragraph IDs instead of
scanning every glyph record in JavaScript. A renderer preparation failure discards its candidate, retains the last
accepted plan fence and error, and waits for explicit renderer-relevant invalidation to request a checkpoint. Dirty upload
ranges accumulate across presentation restoration and Rust patches; buffer/resource generations dispose only their exact
dependent materials; and direct materials survive indexed transform-table growth. A loaded font owns one
cached Three binding and decoded resource set: disposal marks them for retirement, while the final registered-stack lease
keeps them valid and then disposes the Wasm binding before removing renderer resources. The unchanged
eight-warmup/31-sample public 25,515-glyph lane measures
17.84/6.32/3.04/13.84 ms medians and 18.99/6.64/4.60/14.01 ms p95 for cold/font-size/width/text. The adjacent recorded
run was 19.42/6.59/3.10/14.24 ms median; process-separated samples support no regression and a plausible cold-path
reduction, not causal attribution.

The canonical direct benchmark loads the packaged `dist/text-shaper.wasm`: Cargo release optimization, LTO, one codegen
unit, default-on `simd128`, stripping, and `wasm-opt -Oz --enable-simd` have already run. On the identical Rust artifact,
Binaryen `-O3` and `-O4` added 11,976 and 13,661 raw bytes without a demonstrated latency improvement. The
evidence-backed pipeline is now `--merge-similar-functions -Oz --merge-similar-functions -Oz` (D-244): the merge pass
finds nothing after `-Oz` alone, but sandwiched runs remove 8,248 raw bytes from the shaper and 29,289 across the four
bakers with hot-path lanes unchanged within noise. Explicit `#[inline(never)]` stage seams in the update path measured
size-neutral (+241 raw) and were rejected — the large export body is stage aggregation, not duplication.

SIMD expansion follows recorded kernel-lab admission (D-245). The complete scalar/auto-vectorized/explicit comparison
over real paragraph arrays is checked in as shaper evidence: explicit break-opportunity masks run 7.6×, bidi transition
masks 4.8×, and chunk-64 advance summaries 2.2× faster than auto-vectorization, while the pack loop and the production
policy interpreter confirm their earlier scalar and explicit choices. The mask and chunk kernels have no production
consumer yet; they adopt alongside the 11.14 line-planner work behind `cfg(simd128)` with exact scalar-parity tests. The `<4 ms` warm-path target and stable p95 closure remain open.

Cargo `opt-level` is likewise evidence-pinned per crate (D-242). A four-variant shaper matrix (whole-`z`,
dependency-only `z`, HarfRust-family `s`, whole-`s`) shrank the 1,160,223-byte artifact to 890,381–1,076,427 raw bytes,
but every variant regressed shaping-bound benchmark lanes beyond acceptance — whole-`z` roughly doubled all five lanes,
and even HarfRust-`s` cost +22% cold and +27% suffix-edit — because the HarfRust bytes that dominate size are the
shaping hot path. The inverse holds for the parser-generic bakers: forcing `z` or `s` inflates the Bitmap, MTSDF, and
Slug bakers by 26–123 KB over their `-O3` builds, and rebuilding the font baker at `3` or `s` inflates it by 192 or
95 KB over its current `z`, so every crate already sits at its measured per-crate optimum and further size reduction
proceeds through code-shape changes rather than optimizer flags.

The first such change is the shared engine sort kernel (D-243). Every engine ordering now lowers its key into a
`u64` — packed integer fields, or the order-preserving bit image of an `f64` under `total_cmp` — and sorts retained
`(key, source index)` pairs through one instantiation, applying the permutation by cycle walking; the four-field style
cascade key runs as two stable passes over the same kernel. The index tiebreak makes every engine ordering total and
deterministic, sort-algorithm independent, and allocation-free in steady state. This removed 50,579 raw / 14,458 gzip
bytes; measured sort bodies fell from 115.5 KiB in 64 functions to 79.5 KiB in 45, of which 45.5 KiB is HarfRust-internal
and unreachable without a fork. The 22k-glyph benchmark lanes are unchanged within noise (cold 16.41 vs 16.51 ms,
suffix-edit 14.01 vs 13.93 ms medians).

The final sequential eight-warmup/31-sample checkpoint uses the unchanged 22,000-target corpus, which resolves to 25,515
positioned and 21,805 renderable glyphs. Values below are medians in milliseconds for the complete packaged Rust
transaction and raster-format-specific command-buffer publication; GPU submission is outside this direct benchmark.

| Raster format |  Cold | Font size | Column width | Suffix edit | Local edit | Middle splice |
| ------------- | ----: | --------: | -----------: | ----------: | ---------: | ------------: |
| Bitmap        | 15.90 |      6.04 |         2.78 |       13.48 |       1.18 |          8.52 |
| MTSDF         | 16.50 |      6.41 |         2.73 |       13.52 |       1.18 |          8.73 |
| Slug          | 16.73 |      6.64 |         2.96 |       14.37 |       1.31 |          8.94 |

The migration comparison is checked evidence rather than a reconstructed recollection. Commit `90964be0`, the exact
`feat/three-api` base, was rebuilt in an isolated worktree using its own lockfile and original
`glyph:layout-benchmark` workflow on this Darwin arm64 host. At the same eight-warmup/31-sample cadence its retained
TypeScript path measured 58.32/12.09/9.15/39.61 ms for cold/font-size/width/suffix-edit medians. The current Bitmap,
MTSDF, and Slug records all use one byte-identical optimized shaper Wasm and the complete `pmndrs_glyph_engine_update` plus
raster-format-specific Rust command-buffer publication. The base reports 25,515 positioned glyphs; the current publication reports 21,805
renderable instances from the unchanged 22,000-glyph target because it omits non-rendering glyphs from GPU records.

The exact [TypeScript baseline](../../../benches/fixtures/results/typescript-layout-baseline-90964be0-darwin-arm64.json)
and current [Bitmap](../../../benches/fixtures/results/rust-layout-bitmap-0bdb9e93-darwin-arm64.json),
[MTSDF](../../../benches/fixtures/results/rust-layout-mtsdf-0bdb9e93-darwin-arm64.json), and
[Slug](../../../benches/fixtures/results/rust-layout-slug-0bdb9e93-darwin-arm64.json) records are authenticated by
the benchmark fixture gate. Every comparable median is faster through Rust: Bitmap is 3.67× faster cold, 2.00× on font
size, 3.29× on width, and 2.94× on suffix edit; even the slowest technique for each case remains 3.49×, 1.82×, 3.09×,
and 2.76× faster. This proves the migration comparison on this machine; it does not close the stricter p95-under-4-ms
objective. Local-edit p95 remains about 6 ms and high-variance, while width p95 ranges from 4.29 to 4.75 ms across
raster formats.

The paragraph-scoped synchronous measure (11.17) closes that objective for the explicit measure shape. At the same
22,000-glyph corpus and cadence, the new `measure-query` lane answers the identical alternating widths as the
`column-resize` lane through `pmndrs_glyph_engine_measure_paragraph`: 1.815 ms median / 1.930 ms p95 / 3.0% RSD with
zero patches and zero publication bytes, beside the full update's 2.996 ms median / 4.483 ms p95 / 21.7% RSD in the
same run — the first width-change lane under the 4 ms p95 objective, recorded in the
[measure-query record](../../../benches/fixtures/results/rust-layout-bitmap-measure-a42c976-darwin-arm64.json).
The variance collapse follows from what the query skips: no gather, no plan compile, no publication packing, and no
revision burn, so the following ordinary frame adopts the speculative layout instead of paying a checkpoint rebuild.

The preceding unchanged 22,000-glyph localized-edit lane measured the complete production `pmndrs_glyph_engine_update` plus Bitmap render
plan at 2.607 ms median / 6.184 ms p95 after 40 warmups over 101 updates. The fast ASCII-letter path reuses Unicode and
bidi state and recomposes until the line cursor converges; punctuation and spacing edits deliberately retain the full
break-sensitive path, so the 42.4% RSD describes remaining workload classes rather than a completed latency result. The
optimized SIMD shaper is 1,147,266 raw bytes. Five patches write roughly 1.2 KiB per update, and the retained high-water
mark remains 80.38 MiB. Median is now below 4 ms, but p95 and memory-growth gates remain open.

Codec gather now retains complete prior input lanes by committed planner/Codec/capability revision. Zero-change glyphs
reuse them without binding or Codec work; changed glyphs update only reachable lanes. A resource or draw-storage key
change retains the verified prefix and fully rebuilds the suffix, preserving correct replacement-buffer inputs without
double-scanning the prefix. The same production lane now measures 1.314 ms median / 5.863 ms p95 with 76.2% RSD, five
patches, and roughly 1.2 KiB written. The 1,153,122-byte optimized shaper is 5,856 bytes larger than the prior checkpoint,
and retained high-water memory is 80.19 MiB. The fast class approaches 1 ms; the break-sensitive p95 remains open.

The ordered-direct compiler additionally retains committed glyph-to-batch and glyph-to-slot topology while Codec,
capability, glyph count, and every physical storage key remain compatible. It still validates every glyph and stable
identity; the first storage mismatch falls back to complete batch discovery. Three consecutive optimized runs measured
1.164/5.761, 1.153/5.740, and 1.155/5.738 ms median/p95, versus the preceding 1.314/5.863 ms checkpoint. The optimized
shaper is 1,157,311 raw bytes, a 4,189-byte increase, and retained high-water memory is 79.81 MiB. The repeated median gain
is established; the roughly 5.74 ms p95 and 81.4–81.6% RSD still fail the tail-latency gate.

Three retains pending attribute upload ranges until its renderer consumes them. Consecutive Rust publications and
presentation-origin restoration before rendering coalesce overlapping or adjacent ranges instead of clearing earlier
writes. Paragraph transform identities return to a binding-local free list only after the Rust removal
transaction commits, bounding the indexed transform table under create/dispose churn. A disposed `Text` may remain in
the Three scene graph until its host detaches it without poisoning the surviving batch, and batch-wide runtime validation
runs inside the group error boundary before reconciliation mutates ownership. Semantic queries use the nonpublishing
paragraph-measure call; an internal query contract failure leaves the engine revision and renderer fence untouched and
throws from the query. Focused public integration exercises all four lifecycles. The canonical direct benchmark defaults
to eight warmups and 31 measured samples so its reported p95 is not the maximum of an 11-sample run.

The Wasm boundary also retains fixed-seed mutation coverage for the two replacement parsers. Sixty-four policy and frame
mutations run twice with identical status sequences, include accepted and rejected paths, and prove that every malformed
input leaves a fresh valid transaction usable. This supplements the Rust parser unit cases at the compiled ABI rather
than restoring any deleted `shapeBatch`, `reshapeRanges`, or TypeScript paragraph state machine. The package gate now
contains 165 Node integration tests plus three deterministic fuzz-smoke tests.

D-254 introduced scale-late F26.6 fixed-point layout decisions, and PR #134 later raised the decision lane to 16
fractional bits stored in `i64`. The current rounding contract is `floor(value * 65,536 + 1/2)` with caller-derived values
bounded to ±2^53 integer units. Cluster values, chunk summaries, fitting, and justification use the `i64` lane; the
authoritative shaped advances and intra-line positioning cursor remain `f64`, and semantic, query, Codec, and renderer
geometry narrows to the public `f32` contract. The original migration landed as stacked slices with an interleaved
same-run A/B for each — sides alternated in identical order within one process session because this host drifts several
percent between sessions. Historical step deltas, medians at the 22,000-glyph corpus:

Break admission is inclusive and exact in that integer lane: equal fits, one layout unit below breaks, and one above
fits, with indexed and scalar word paths pinned to the same result. Measurement sizes, content extents, and intrinsic
widths round outward at the public f32 boundary whenever nearest rounding would undershoot their retained f64 authority.
This prevents a raw measure-to-exact feedback loop from presenting less width than the line it just measured without
adding a floating epsilon or history-dependent hysteresis. Host adapters still round outward to their own point scale
after padding, border, and layout-engine arithmetic.

The stream replaces the glyph permutation with six adjacency-order payload columns scattered at build, so positioning
walks sequential memory and geometry-only updates reuse the stream untouched; a metrics-only restyle re-derives just the
advance lanes from that stream in one sequential pass, bit-identical to a cold build by a lane-for-lane oracle.
Justification distributes euclideanly in layout units — per-site quotient plus a remainder spread one unit over leading
sites — so the fragment advance and the applied cursor adjustments agree exactly, and the compression capacity
quantizes through the same `ratio_q16` expression the fit used to admit the line. The
[integer-units checkpoint record](../../../benches/fixtures/results/rust-layout-bitmap-integer-units-c2e895e-darwin-arm64.json)
pins the slice-4 artifact end-state (measure-query 1.890/2.054 ms median/p95 on a visibly hot host session; the
interleaved deltas above are the comparative evidence).

Corpus re-derivation statement: the packaged fixtures held byte-identical through every slice except the deliberate
quantized-boundary re-pins recorded with their commits — one RTL ellipsis extent at the slice-2b flip (+0.0134 px), the
paragraph bidi and CJK contracts (30 and 25 numeric leaves, maxima 0.070 px and 0.101 px, the latter a long Korean
line's accumulated per-site sub-unit quantization), and the advanced-shaping and rich-text composed hashes, whose
roughly twenty-five structural pins each — glyph and draw counts, line counts, both first-line break positions — held
exactly while the historical F26.6 origins settled on 1/64 boundaries. Integer justification required no re-pin: both contract corpora and
the sixteen-scenario conformance suite reproduce byte-identically because their justified cases divide evenly. Native
and Wasm agree bit-for-bit on the contract corpora by construction of the shared rounding contract, and the linux CI
host reproduces both composed scenario hashes recorded on this darwin host.

PR #134 re-derived the affected deterministic fixtures when the decision lane moved to 1/65,536 units. That refinement
did not make glyph positioning integer: the `f64` pen remains a deliberate seam, and a future integer-pen change requires
its own explicit corpus re-derivation.

The review fold that closed the migration replaced the fit's Q16 shrink budget with an exactly-applied f64 ratio —
one IEEE multiply and one round-half-up per comparison, shared verbatim by justification's growth and compression
caps and by the f64 parity twin — after a review counterexample showed the Q16 ratio's 2^-17 relative error
exceeding the one-unit tolerance above ~2^16-unit space sums and its `<<16` comparison overflowing i64 inside the
admitted magnitude range. The same fold bounded justification application to the counted span in visual encounter
order (trailing logical spaces and uncounted gaps no longer absorb adjustments, so the applied cursor sum equals
the reported fragment advance in both directions), required positional run-topology stability before the
metric-only scale refresh (a metrics restyle can merge adjacent runs and dangle retained run indices), and
collapsed the build's payload scatter to bulk copies when shaped runs tile the glyph array in cluster order.

The measure-query stretch target is met: a measurement-only query now skips the per-glyph positioning tail —
measurement derives at line level from flow and clusters, glyph totals from the adjacency stream and boundary
records, and the committing frame runs exactly the missing tail once, proven byte-identical to a never-measured
control by an integration test. The lane moved from 1.82–1.90 ms to 0.458 ms median / 0.607 ms p95 (−75%,
three interleaved rounds), inside the plan's 0.6–0.9 ms objective; the earlier attribution of the residual floor
to the fit walk was wrong — the floor was the positioning tail. The identity-order scatter reclaimed the
retained-stream cost on the edit lanes (suffix and splice both −1.6%, three rounds); font-size pays +1.2% for the
correctness admissions and remains ~11% below the pre-stream baseline. Still open: the committing-resize
p95-under-4-ms objective. The tail is structural, not noise — 4.42–4.49 p95 against a 2.8 ms median on both sides
of every round — and belongs to break-sensitive full recomposition; the productized interactive width path is the
measure query above, and the raw full-update tail remains the documented open gate.

Per-sample attribution (the benchmark's `--samples` dump, 101 widening reps at 22k glyphs) later replaced that
characterization with measured structure: the resize distribution has three classes, none of them noise. A third of
the samples — widths whose +7 px quantized to an identical layout — published ZERO bytes yet still cost ~3.2 ms:
the engine re-fits, re-positions, re-gathers, and re-diffs the full corpus to discover nothing changed. The bulk
class (~60%) republishes the entire ~170 KB positioned output as one patch at ~3.5 ms, and the p95 class (~6%,
present in every width quartile) writes the same bytes at ~5.4 ms of roughly doubled compute. The identified fix
for the first class is a break-sequence equivalence short-circuit: the integer fit is cheap and chunk-skipped, so
when the composed lines equal the committed lines under unchanged text and styles, the positioning, gather, and
publication tail can adopt committed state and publish nothing — the same adoption shape D-253 established for
measure transactions.

That short-circuit is landed. `flow_positioning_equivalent` proves, per fragment, bit-equality of the cluster
range, the computed pen origin (slot start plus indent shift plus alignment offset), and the justify distribution
against the committed flow — exactly the inputs positioning consumes — and the geometry-only update path then
aborts the pending flow, retains committed positioning, and commits the new constraint, which the equivalence
proof is precisely the license for. End alignment, centering, justified spans with changed slot spans, and
boundary-bearing flows fail the proof and take the full path; a unit matrix pins each discrimination and an
integration sequence drives adopt → relayout → adopt across the equivalence boundary. Measured at the same
101-rep widening sweep: the zero-publication class (34 of 101 frames) drops from ~3.2 ms to 0.357 ms median
(−89%), the published classes are unchanged, and every other lane is neutral over two interleaved rounds. The
lane median and p95 are order statistics over the published classes and move little; what changed is that a
third of resize frames now cost a third of a millisecond.

The completing reflow pass keeps shaped-word composition data beside the retained cluster lanes. Only a paragraph whose
active geometry requests word wrapping lazily builds the sidecar. Sparse prose records one 12-byte
`(cluster_end, advance_units, space_units)` entry per legal word break plus its terminal segment; a paragraph with at
least one break per two clusters stays on the existing cluster/chunk path, so ordinary dense CJK never pays a sidecar
record per character even when shaping produces a negative advance. Paragraphs shorter than one 64-cluster layout
chunk also stay on the allocation-free scalar path, so ordinary labels never construct the word index. The existing
chunk flag byte marks negative advances, and its existing auxiliary `i64` lane is interpreted by those flags as either
the shrinkable-space sum or, for a negative space-free chunk, the largest advance prefix. This proves that every local
break boundary fits before skipping that chunk. A chunk combining spaces with a negative advance takes the exact scalar
path, preserving hanging-space and shrink semantics without another lane, Wasm ABI field, glyph-record byte, or warm
allocation. Word fitting consumes complete shaped segments before testing the width, including the same word-space
shrink budget used by justification. This fixes the case where an early positive glyph advance followed by a negative
shaping adjustment incorrectly pushed a word to the next line even though the completed word fit. It does not reshape
or split a previously shaped word.

The legal stream begins with Unicode 17 UAX #14 opportunities, discards any optional opportunity that falls inside a
UAX #29 extended grapheme, and intersects the result with HarfRust unsafe-to-break shaping boundaries. The default has
no dictionary segmentation, language-specific hyphenation, or locale tailoring. Optional language-resource imports,
including a versioned linear-memory ABI that can move language tables out of the default Wasm payload, are tracked in
[#163](https://github.com/pmndrs/glyph/issues/163); no renderer adapter may become a second layout implementation.

After composition, start-aligned lines whose semantic range, fragment order, indent, baseline, transform, clip, slot
origin, and final-line state are unchanged copy their committed positioned SoA slices even when a wider slot changes
only its unused end. Retained lines copy their indexed decoration slice with their glyph and semantic slices; a changed
slot start invalidates reuse because it changes the published semantic line extent. Nontrivial bidi, center/end
alignment, justification changes, boundary reshaping, and any changed line geometry take the full positioning path. At 22,000 glyphs and 101 widening updates, the final candidate measured
1.882/4.553 ms median/p95 versus exact remote main's 2.991/5.256 ms. The dedicated measurement query measured
0.282/0.341 ms versus 0.517/0.711 ms. Two browser Paragraph Stress A/B pairs retained 11,510 glyphs in one draw: the
candidate/main retained-update medians were 0.665/0.795 and 0.750/0.785 ms, while update-plus-measure medians were
0.510/0.580 and 0.565/0.605 ms. These machine-local observations establish repeated direction and a lower common-case
cost; width reflow remains above the sub-1-ms interactive target and is still the last post-shaping performance frontier.

The [fragment-relative reflow plan](../planning/fragment-relative-reflow.md) owns that next frontier. It must preserve the
word sidecar and chunk summaries as fit indexes, retain current shaping and bidi authority, and prove that width or obstacle
changes patch stable run placement instead of republishing unchanged glyph-local geometry. This paragraph records the
baseline only; it does not claim that `LayoutRun`, public contour authoring, projected objects, or drop caps are implemented.

Large `measure()` and `glyphs()` queries reserve against the result arena's reported capacity and required watermark.
Each retry must strictly grow the arena
or return the typed engine error. This fixes alternating large inspection queries without an arbitrary retry count and
without changing normal publication or cached-query work.

The [historical integer layout-units record](../planning/integer-layout-units.md) retains the one deliberately open numeric
seam: decisions resolve in the 16-fraction-bit `i64` lane while the intra-line cursor accumulates and resynchronizes against
the `f64` advance lane. Fragment-relative reflow keeps those decision and internal-computation domains, but the pre-alpha
package now deliberately re-pins the final public/render coordinate operation to separately narrowed run-local and
placement `f32` components followed by one specified `f32` addition. This is not an integer-pen migration. The
prepared/pending state-machine follow-up is complete under D-258: every stage is a `Staged<T>`, and staging new flow
invalidates stale positioning by construction.

## Fragment-relative reflow frontier

PR #161 is merged. Its retained word fitting, line reuse, partial update sections, paragraph ordering, synchronous queries,
publication lifecycle, and renderer batching are the baseline rather than open merge gates. Milestone 12's proof,
single-model cutover, renderer integration, and ordered-only cleanup gates are closed. Public contour, projected-object,
and drop-cap authoring remain later milestones; the placement work does not imply those APIs.

The M0/M1 harness first derived maximal shaping-compatible `LayoutRun` intervals from retained cluster ownership without
changing production execution. Production now treats those as post-shaping geometry runs: adjacent shaping runs may
share one `LayoutRun` after shaping when direction, resolved bidi level, selected font, and layout geometry agree, so a
Han/kana/punctuation script transition does not manufacture a renderer placement entity. Direction, bidi, fallback-font,
and shaping/layout-style changes still split the run. `ClusterArena` retains that topology, makes it the sole flow-extents traversal,
and uses it to hoist font geometry for boundary-free, zero-indent, trivial-order positioning, including justified lines.
Bidi, boundary replacement, and indented fragments still use the same shared cluster-emission authority without
run-level hoisting. Maintained benchmark cases isolate justified, mixed-bidi,
equivalent-width, and dense-CJK reflow and retain raw publication counters. The frozen pre-cutover Bitmap checkpoint
measured 22k width updates at `1.144 / 3.605 ms` aggregate median/p95 and `1.493 / 3.743 ms` on the active 174,440-byte
publication subset; measurement-only was `0.192 / 0.226 ms`. Those values remain attribution baselines, not performance
claims for the production slice.

The initial proof consumers establish maximal `(source_run, font_handle)` runs, one-run dense CJK, run-bounded line extents, exact
visual occurrence ownership, and replacement-run ownership. They also reject plain local-plus-translation arithmetic as a
legacy-bit-preserving transform: deterministic inline and block counterexamples change final f32 bits, and a 4,111-case
representation lab finds mismatches in every tested compact candidate. The active-resize benchmark alternates
420/434-unit widths and fails on any zero-patch sample.

Those counterexamples close the old-bit question for the retained additive placement model. The package is pre-alpha and
publishes one indexed placement contract without a compatibility branch. Each rendered glyph's semantic row carries an
engine-owned `placementSlot`; the planner resolves that slot to one root-scoped f32x2 x/y row shared by every compatible
resource and material batch. Raster Codec authors continue to name semantic and raster values rather than slots, tables,
bind groups, or physical buffer layouts. Package-private host assembly stores the slot, and each adapter chooses its
physical packing before applying the same ordered local-plus-placement f32 addition. A 65,536-case finite arithmetic
regression proves this is the same commutative f32 addition the former Codec-side absolute raster origin used;
tiny-world, justification, cancellation, retained-update, and browser-pixel evidence still gate milestone completion.

Static local coordinates cannot be anchored to visual slices because width changes move dense-CJK slice boundaries. The
exact anchor policy remains evidence-gated; an admissible bounded-local form may use fixed, break-independent numeric
blocks inside one stable `LayoutRun`. Their boundaries may use stable glyph/cluster adjacencies even when the edge is not
`CLUSTER_SAFE_BEFORE`, because numeric partitioning neither reshapes nor permits a line break. Admission scans the full
two-dimensional running geometry envelope: direction-canonical glyph cursors, negative advances, cluster
resynchronization, shaping and baseline offsets, semantic origins, and ink coordinates derived from extents. Placement
uses stability-aware source-slice/numeric-block/visual-segment intersections. Sparse prose retains safe word-root slots
from the existing sidecar even when adjacent translations match and splits within a word only at a real displacement or
boundary change. Dense CJK uses fixed numeric blocks and current visual segments without per-glyph runs or rows. Numeric
blocks are not run identity, line entities, batch keys, or draws.

The numeric gate measures local narrowing, translation narrowing, and the final ordered f32 add separately. Fixed,
break-independent numeric blocks bound local geometry; boundary replacement glyphs own distinct replacement `LayoutRun`
geometry and blocks for their committed topology lifetime rather than borrowing a paragraph-source identity. Warmed width
updates with unchanged text, font/local geometry, and replacement topology publish no static glyph-local/numeric-block
bytes.

The visual proof joins independent multi-fragment bidi, per-fragment hanging-space, and justification-site oracles to a
safe-boundary mapper. It preserves multi-glyph cluster order and glyphless ownership, rejects boundary replacement until
it has an explicit occurrence model, and keeps 4,096 homogeneous CJK clusters in one retained run. A 166-glyph real
corpus reconstructs all 332 already-published f32 coordinates exactly from line and observable-slice anchors, but the
f64 reassociation counterexamples remain authoritative for the future CPU cutover.

Break-independent numeric blocks, compact placement segments, and placement slots are production-owned and populated by
the single positioning traversal. A LayoutRun's canonical revision and stable source anchor identify its retained local
geometry; there is no separate run-slot allocator or renderer-visible run handle. Justification, L1/L2, hanging,
boundary ownership, and exact f64 translation remain in core; the
renderer receives only a per-glyph u32 slot and the selected f32x2 row. CPU semantic/query rows and renderer placement use
the same ordered local-plus-placement f32 operation. Run, word, numeric-block, role, bidi, and justification metadata do
not cross the renderer boundary.

`ClusterArena` prepares one stable u32 placement-segment anchor per cluster after word fitting and LayoutRun topology are
available. Short, sparse, and overflow word-sidecar modes retain the stable word root; dense break streams retain the
LayoutRun root, and a glyphless hard break owns its own stable cluster ID. Positioning therefore resolves the segment
anchor in O(1) instead of searching backward or advancing a sparse-record cursor for every visited cluster. The
positioned placement arena stores one rendered-instance count per compact segment rather than repeating one segment
index for every rendered glyph. Retained lines copy those compact counts, and final slot binding walks each contiguous
segment-owned glyph range once. Word fitting remains independently usable without LayoutRun state; paragraph flow
prepares placement anchors as an explicit subsequent step.

Retained geometry-only positioning has a matching guarded path for visually trivial, boundary-free, undecorated text. It
reuses committed glyph-local, raster, and effect rows, copies compact placement metadata, and refreshes clip, region,
thread, and transform metadata. Internal positioned semantic rows keep local origin and ink coordinates plus their
placement-segment index; pure placement changes therefore preserve their content revision and do not dirty static Codec
position inputs. Public borrowed/full glyph queries and CPU/plan ink bounds compose absolute f32 values lazily from the
authoritative segment translation. Plan gather requires that positioned semantic row and translation and derives semantic
identity from the same row; malformed internal input is rejected rather than interpreting local coordinates as absolute or
falling back to a parallel semantic lane. Retained gather resolves only genuinely changed Codec dependencies without repeating
font selection, raster resource lookup, full `PlanGlyph` construction, or glyph-position arithmetic. Stable/glyph/font
identity and exact outline presence authenticate retained rows; any mismatch aborts the candidate. Other changes use the
general authorities.

Placement-slot identity follows the stable occurrence source rather than the run's geometry revision. Paragraph,
boundary-source, and ellipsis runs remain distinct source kinds, but changing font metrics or other canonical run geometry
does not by itself retire and rewrite the per-glyph placement-slot lane. The run canonical revision still changes
independently and guards static local geometry. In the maintained full font-size update, this separation reduced candidate
publication from 456.5 KiB to 371.3 KiB by removing the redundant approximately 85 KiB occurrence rewrite; the measured
CPU timing change was within noise and is not claimed as a speedup.

The intermediate direct-offset A/B/B/A ordered Bitmap comparison used 40 warmups and two 101-sample passes per revision. Pooled candidate
median/p95 is `2.874 / 2.915 ms` for 21,805 Latin glyphs and `2.233 / 2.258 ms` for 21,978 dense-CJK glyphs. Exact clean
main measures `3.697 / 3.754 ms` for Latin and `2.909 / 2.968 ms` for CJK. The retained candidate is therefore 22.3%
faster at the Latin median and 23.2% faster at the CJK median, with 22.4% and 23.9% lower p95 respectively. Every
active-resize sample still emitted one glyph-wide f32x2 patch—174,440 bytes for Latin and 175,824 bytes for CJK—so these
results establish the retained CPU positioning win but do not measure the current indexed publication path.

A corrected indexed-publication smoke over the same 21,805-glyph Latin resize produced 3,903 active placement rows and
one 31,224-byte session-table patch on every measured update. It produced zero placement-slot writes and zero
static/raster writes because the stable word-root assignments did not change. This is the expected compact transfer shape,
and the five-sample smoke authenticated the dirty buffers and byte count before the full interleaved benchmark gauntlet.

The corrected indexed A/B matrix pools three independent 101-sample passes after 40 warmups for both exact
`2094243668bcf5462cff0ac3b1f7faf52cba3b6c` main and the candidate. Bitmap Latin improves from
`3.741 / 3.829 ms` median/p95 to `2.584 / 2.680 ms` while writes fall from 174,440 to 31,224 bytes; dense-CJK Bitmap
improves from `2.986 / 3.153 ms` to `2.268 / 2.292 ms` while its two alternating states write 103,880 or 109,200 bytes
instead of 175,824. Justified Latin improves from `3.675 / 3.726 ms` to `3.447 / 3.491 ms` and writes 31,344 bytes
instead of 174,440. MTSDF and Slug Latin improve from `4.079 / 4.131 ms` and `4.031 / 4.098 ms` to
`2.683 / 2.708 ms` and `2.639 / 2.743 ms`; both write 31,224 rather than 348,880 bytes. Mixed bidi is the explicit
exception: it regresses from `3.956 / 4.065 ms` to `4.520 / 4.685 ms` while reducing publication from 176,352 to
35,856 bytes. The bidi CPU regression remains open for browser end-to-end attribution; it is not averaged into a general
speedup claim.

A follow-up same-harness A/B/B/A comparison isolates the compact-count and precomputed-anchor change against exact
branch parent `2b6d5eb3`. Each resize pass used 8 warmups and 31 measured samples, pooling 62 samples per revision.
Justified Latin improves from `3.450 / 3.616 ms` median/p95 to `3.218 / 3.251 ms` (−6.7%/−10.1%); mixed bidi improves
from `4.490 / 4.603 ms` to `4.404 / 4.503 ms` (−1.9%/−2.2%); ordinary Latin improves from `2.584 / 2.656 ms` to
`2.540 / 2.624 ms` (−1.7%/−1.2%); and dense CJK improves from `2.293 / 2.324 ms` to `2.278 / 2.306 ms`
(−0.7%/−0.8%). Patch counts and bytes are unchanged: 31,344 justified, 35,856 bidi, 31,224 ordinary Latin, and the
same alternating 103,880/109,200 dense-CJK bytes. A separate 20-warmup, 202-sample-per-revision cold comparison measures
only +0.4%/+0.5% Latin/CJK median; p95 changes −1.9%/+1.5%. The optimized Wasm is 339 raw bytes smaller. This is
incremental attribution against the immediate parent, not a substitute for the final fresh-main performance gauntlet.

The intermediate direct-offset `adopt-position-query` case prepared borrowed-layout positioning before timing the remaining transaction.
For the same final Latin fixture, measurement is `0.220 / 0.227 ms`, measurement plus positioning is
`1.222 / 1.248 ms`, and adoption plus retained gather, plan compilation, and publication is `1.655 / 1.688 ms`. The
dense-CJK publication tail is `0.973 / 0.998 ms`. These phases explain the complete median rather than forming a second
layout path: glyph-wide direct-offset publication was about 58% of the Latin total, per-glyph positioning about 35%, and line fitting
about 8% after rounding.

The current indexed renderer contract is exercised as product code rather than a synthetic placement graph. Direct TypeGPU
renders Bitmap/MSDF/Slug through project Chromium WebGPU with nonzero-alpha counts `2148/2010/1992`. Native Three TSL and
the experimental Three/TypeGPU shader set each pass Bitmap/MSDF/Slug, retained storage/draw, detached-copy, decoration,
and custom-composition gates on WebGPU and forced WebGL2 with identical per-backend counts. These runs close the basic
indexed browser-realization gate; the full editorial pixel/performance and soak matrix remains open. Both Three and direct
TypeGPU store Slug's `placementSlot` in the existing unused `bandCounts.z` lane. Slug therefore retains seven technique
records plus its separate stable-glyph identity record under the eight-buffer Codec contract; its vertex pipeline binds
the seven technique records and reads one shared scene-owned x/y placement table from storage. Placement uses neither a
texture nor an additional Codec buffer or draw. Direct TypeGPU remains a proof-of-concept, but this measured physical
choice no longer exceeds the contract it advertises.

The planner-scoped placement allocator reconciles compact CPU placement topology transactionally and quarantines retired
slots until renderer acknowledgement. Its focused lifecycle tests validate reorder, retirement, acknowledgement,
abort/retry, and stale-slot reuse directly; there is no parallel run allocator, canonical-update mode, batch identity, or
draw identity. Its desired and occupied values are the planner's `PlacementLogicalKey` directly; the former generic
one-field wrappers carried no additional invariant and are removed. The standalone M1 visual-span and multi-fragment
shadow planners were retired after the complete 12.1–12.5
core, renderer, browser, size, and performance matrix closed; focused production-path regressions remain authoritative.

The final reduction layer removes 4,785 net non-documentation lines relative to the accepted placement-publication
checkpoint without changing batches, primitives, draws, stable identity, or the x/y placement contract. Instrumented
Rust production coverage is unchanged after consolidating six overlapping tests; built-package Node coverage slightly
increases while 241 overlapping cases are removed. A final ownership audit keeps four large Rust modules because they
own different stages: paragraph-local f64 segments, fixed run-local geometry, root occurrence-slot identity and
acknowledgement-gated reuse, and the root f32x2 renderer buffer. The bounded follow-up removes a repeated retained
segment-resolution pass, a duplicate glyph-advance field, fixed per-instance placement-buffer metadata, and the last
wildcard-exported host Codec assembler.

On the rebuilt 20-warmup/101-sample 22k alternating-width harness, the cleaned head measures `1.626 ms` ordinary Latin,
`2.248 ms` justified Latin, `3.565 ms` mixed bidi, and `2.462 ms` dense CJK median, publishing
`30.6/30.6/35.1/96.3 KiB` respectively. The same-host main medians are `3.725/3.281/3.953/2.995 ms`, so all four current
paths remain faster. Against PR #175, the shaper is 7,738 raw / 2,989 gzip / 2,679 Brotli bytes smaller. Three is
8,652 raw / 8,426 minified / 2,203 gzip / 1,728 Brotli bytes smaller; Three+TypeGPU is 8,609 / 8,431 / 2,124 / 1,538
bytes smaller. Direct TypeGPU is +1 raw / −5 minified / +3 gzip / +45 Brotli bytes. Against exact main, the completed
feature costs 161,147 raw / 59,828 gzip / 42,769 Brotli shaper bytes, 27,021 / 6,899 / 5,409 Three bytes, and
7,394 / 1,466 / 1,175 direct-TypeGPU bytes; those are retained feature costs rather than duplicate live-deformation
storage, which is absent.

A ten-window hardware WebGPU dynamic-layout rerun keeps one draw and 387 glyphs in every 120-frame window. The median
window is `0.573 ms` CPU and `0.858 ms` GPU, versus main's same-machine `0.655/0.853 ms`; the CPU path is 12.6% faster,
while the `0.005 ms` GPU difference is noise-level parity. Direct TypeGPU's project-Chromium live gate passes Bitmap,
MTSDF, and Slug with its callback bind groups, placement updates, and disposal lifecycle.

The indexed direction keeps the existing batches, physical instances, primitive spans, and draws. Direct physical
addressing reads `placementSlot[physical]` and the shared session row. A portable `RasterCodec.codecBody` receives
only the frozen renderer capability set and authors glyph-local technique outputs. After authenticating that body,
package-private host assembly appends stable identity, optional transform identity, and the slot store. Codec authors
therefore describe glyph meaning and raster inputs, not slot allocation, tables, bind groups, or backend memory layout,
and they cannot accidentally omit or collide with system lanes. An adapter may keep a separate u32 lane or pack the slot
into a proven-unused technique lane without changing the public Codec plan or creating a run/slice batch key.

An earlier indexed cleanup checkpoint remained 4–5% slower than main while still publishing the baseline 170.4/171.7 KiB;
that result is negative evidence about the incomplete implementation, not the current 31,224-byte publication shape. The
intermediate direct-offset candidate isolated a real retained CPU speedup but preserved glyph-wide transfer. The current
indexed candidate combines that retained positioning work with compact session rows. Its immediate-parent A/B is
directionally positive across ordinary, justified, bidi, and dense-CJK resize. A subsequent same-machine A/B/B/A against
freshly fetched `origin/main` `ee56fa48` (README-only after the byte-identical `20942436` shaper) used 20 warmups and 101
measured updates per pass, pooling 202 samples per revision. Candidate `8221aa87` improves ordinary Latin from
`3.725 / 3.856 ms` median/p95 to `2.523 / 2.594 ms` (−32.3%/−32.7%), dense CJK from `2.995 / 3.040 ms` to
`2.261 / 2.291 ms` (−24.5%/−24.6%), and justified Latin from `3.281 / 3.685 ms` to `3.195 / 3.276 ms`
(−2.6%/−11.1%). Mixed bidi regresses from `3.953 / 4.071 ms` to `4.407 / 4.516 ms` (+11.5%/+10.9%) even though
publication falls from 176,352 to 35,856 bytes. The fresh-main CPU/publication comparison is therefore complete but the
performance gate remains open on mixed bidi and the full browser/editorial matrix.

The subsequent lazy-absolute-semantic checkpoint removes the remaining width-only semantic position rewrite rather than
changing line fitting, batching, draws, or the renderer placement contract. Two final 20-warmup/101-sample passes pool to
`1.562 / 1.615 ms` median/p95 for ordinary Latin, `3.437 / 3.491 ms` for mixed bidi, and `2.277 / 2.298 ms` for dense
CJK. Justified Latin pools to a `2.229 ms` median; one pass suffered unrelated host stalls, while the independent clean
pass measured `2.189 / 2.210 ms`. Compared with the recorded same-host fresh-main medians (`3.725 / 3.281 / 3.953 /
2.995 ms` for ordinary/justified/bidi/CJK), all four paths are now faster, including mixed bidi by 13.0%. Each update
still publishes only the compact placement data: 31,224 bytes ordinary, 31,344 justified, 35,856 bidi, and 98,560 bytes
across three dense-CJK patches in this final state. The exact package gate passes 982/982 tests plus Rust, type, fuzz,
and format checks. The subsequent browser gauntlet passes all 120 Presentation cells: both native TSL and Three/TypeGPU,
10 workloads, WebGPU/WebGL2, and Bitmap/MTSDF/Slug. Editorial preserves exactly three draws and measures
`0.990–1.710 ms` median reflow across those full runs. Direct TypeGPU's dedicated Chromium WebGPU gate also passes all
three rasters. The reviewed size check accepts a 554-byte raw shaper increase (0.04%); adapter and font sizes are
unchanged. There is no remaining known CPU, publication, renderer, or size regression in this cutover.

Final reduction removes the compile-time justification and text-effect specialization axes from the positioning
traversal. Both conditions are invariant for a fragment or build, and the specialized forms duplicated most of the same
machine code to avoid only a small adjustment tail or optional effect-lane append. One runtime traversal removes 80 Rust
source lines and 26,486 raw / 3,200 gzip optimized-Wasm bytes. A 22k A/B/B/A keeps ordinary, bidi, and dense-CJK width
medians within 0.3%; the longer 501-sample justified comparison is within 0.34%, with identical patches and write bytes.
This is accepted as prediction-friendly parity rather than preserving duplicated code for an unmeasured theoretical win.

The remaining justified penalty was not the integer division or SIMD space scan. Trivial-order positioning had selected
one placement segment per cluster whenever any justification was nonzero. Word-space-only distribution now reuses the
existing stable word/numeric-block segmentation and ends a segment immediately after each adjusted space; nonzero
letter-gap distribution retains cluster granularity because every gap can move the next glyph. A 50-warmup/501-sample
A/B/B/A reduces the 22k justified median from `2.067–2.077 ms` to `1.500–1.510 ms` with the same one patch and 30.6 KiB
write. Ordinary and mixed-bidi controls remain `1.538 ms` and `3.321 ms`. The optimized shaper grows by 175 raw / 162
gzip / 34 Brotli bytes. The existing exact F16.16 quotient/remainder arithmetic and `simd128` flag scan remain
authoritative; no aggregate-count line format or second justification model is added without evidence that the retained
scan is material.

The benchmark also owns a `position-query` case that runs the same break-changing flow and positioning tail through the
borrowed-layout mask while excluding gather, plan compilation, publication, and inspection copies. On the pinned M4 host,
623 rendered Bitmap glyphs measured `0.061 ms` on the frozen main baseline and `0.109 ms` after the initial cutover;
shrinking the shipping run-local glyph row reduced the frontier result to `0.105–0.106 ms`. Direct row addressing for
source-order runs then reduced a stable 22k-glyph positioning comparison from `2.776–2.823 ms` to `2.695–2.701 ms` without
changing RTL/fallback lookup. The matching complete 22k active-resize path improved from `4.067` to `3.893 ms` for Latin
and from `3.650` to `3.607 ms` for dense CJK. Embedding each retained local raster origin in the existing 64-byte
`LayoutGlyph` row then removed two parallel per-glyph vectors and their retained-copy/gather traffic. On the exact rebuilt
source, complete Latin measured `3.864 / 3.994 ms` median/p95 and dense CJK measured `3.195 / 3.218 ms`, with low
`2.21% / 1.23%` relative standard deviation. This confirmed that duplicate origin storage materially amplified the dense
CJK regression, but that earlier incomplete indexed design still did not beat the same-contract baseline.
Those measurements remain attribution history rather than the current package state.

The final ordered-only verification uses exact `origin/main` `ee56fa48` and cleanup head `8457073d`, with two passes per
revision, 20 warmups, and 101 measured updates per pass. Pooled medians/p95 are `1.489/1.581 ms` ordinary Latin,
`1.508/1.589 ms` justified Latin, `3.229/3.351 ms` mixed bidi, and `2.264/2.357 ms` dense CJK. The matching main values are
`3.639/3.784`, `3.698/3.898`, `3.882/4.027`, and `2.897/3.002 ms`, so every final path is faster by 16.8–59.2% at the
median. Publication falls from 174,440/174,440/176,352/175,824 bytes to 31,352/31,352/35,896/98,560 bytes. Relative to
PR #175, the final shaper is 85,192 raw / 26,476 gzip / 15,688 Brotli bytes smaller; browser core is 1,090 / 223 / 82
bytes smaller; Three is 11,217 / 2,790 / 2,223 bytes smaller; direct TypeGPU is 777 / 186 / 104 bytes smaller; and the
combined adapter graph is 11,170 / 2,764 / 2,292 bytes smaller. Relative to main, the retained feature costs 83,693 raw /
36,341 gzip / 29,760 Brotli shaper bytes, 10,837 / 2,808 / 2,185 browser-core bytes, 24,456 / 6,312 / 4,914 Three bytes,
and 6,616 / 1,277 / 1,026 direct-TypeGPU bytes. These are generated-artifact measurements on the pinned arm64 host; the
repository size gate accepts them.

## TypeGPU application integration

`defineTypeGpuConfig({ root, format, sampleCount?, depthStencil?, transformPosition?, transformColor? })` accepts a
caller-owned TypeGPU root and attachment settings, with optional GPU callbacks.
`glyph.handle(name, config)` exposes `createText()` and `draw(pass, { width, height })`; named roots retain independent
publications. The adapter uses public GlyphConfig services and portable bitmap, MSDF, and Slug codecs with direct,
ordered draws. It neither imports Three.js nor submits during `glyph.shape()`. The application ends and submits its pass.

Text options include a loaded FontFace, content, style, paragraph layout, constraints, raster pixel ratio, and 2D position.
MSDF supports outline and shadow. `transformPosition` maps top-left, y-down logical pixel positions (after text translation)
to homogeneous clip coordinates. `transformColor` receives straight RGBA after coverage/effects plus physical fragment
coordinates. Both callbacks are fixed per config and may capture caller-owned uniforms for changes without reshaping.
TypeGPU slots bind them independently per pipeline. Handles and named roots expose `.with(bindGroup)`, returning
an immutable, reusable `TypeGpuDraw` view. Chaining replaces earlier groups for the same layout identity without mutating
parent views; each draw forwards the groups through TypeGPU's pipeline `.with()` API for every retained raster span.
Binding groups does not reshape text or rebuild pipelines. The originating root owns the draw view's lifetime; caller
resources stay caller-owned. TypeGPU reports missing required groups at draw time. Slug estimates its screen-space dilation using nearby projections;
this supports matrix projections exactly and nonlinear deformations approximately. Optional depth state must match the
caller-owned pass attachment; transparent text uses caller-controlled depth writes and ordering.
Decoration lines, rich spans, and third-party raster programs are not part of this high-level API. Renderer buffers and textures are released with their owning roots/resources;
the caller's TypeGPU root stays alive. Shader-only consumers use `/shaders/typegpu`, including independently importable leaves.

The [TypeGPU hello-world package](typegpu-hello-world.md) supplies the application and GPU verification workflow.
MSDF retains Euclidean UV derivative lengths so its antialiasing footprint is invariant under screen rotation.
Both direct TypeGPU and experimental `/three/typegpu` use the shared shader's `std.dpdx`, `std.dpdy`, and `std.inverseSqrt` operations.
TypeGPU 0.12.5 and `@typegpu/gl` 0.12.4 translate these operations to GLSL equivalents; these releases are also
the minimum supported peer versions.
Slug rejects a sorted band's terminating curve before root eligibility and solving;
the emitted WGSL and GLSL checks hold that ordering.

The direct renderer stages owned patch payloads during decode and applies mutations only at commit. Same-capacity
updates reuse CPU storage, GPU allocations, and unchanged draw bindings; uploads cover merged changed ranges, bounded
to 32 ranges per buffer. Resizing replaces storage, and discard releases staged allocations without changing accepted
bytes. A real-engine integration test checks localized edits, allocation and upload costs, rejection, and cold-publication
parity. These are structural cost checks, not GPU timing claims.
The focused TypeGPU suite checks real engine publications, named-root isolation, failed input, updates, and disposal.
The browser probe renders all three formats, checks nonzero alpha, updates, idle frames, empty text, and shared-pass use.
It also verifies uniform-driven perspective and color changes without reshaping, fragment-position access, depth
occlusion, offscreen clipping, and isolation between custom callbacks and the default configuration. Explicit bind-group
checks cover vertex/fragment layouts, replacement, parent-view isolation, missing bindings, named roots, and disposal.

The Three split is exercised through `pnpm scripts run benchmark:v1-bitmap`, with `-- --typegpu` selecting the experimental entry. The same Bitmap, MTSDF, Slug, decoration, retained-update, detached-glyph, and custom-material assertions run on WebGPU and WebGL2 for either config. A focused package test also runs one Bitmap-plus-decoration material factory through `/three` and `/three/typegpu` and requires the same shader context. The packed-consumer test bundles the root and stable `/three` while rejecting any TypeGPU peer request, then proves the TypeGPU shader, direct-renderer, and Three bridge entries both request their optional peers and bundle when those peers are supplied externally.

The split verification on 2026-09-07 passed both browser workflows. Bitmap produced 3,109 lit pixels with native TSL and 2,685 with the experimental shaders on each backend; custom Bitmap composition likewise produced 2,642 versus 2,185. MTSDF and Slug lit-pixel counts matched in these fixtures. These checks establish rendering and lifecycle behavior, not complete visual parity; the Bitmap difference remains a reason to keep the experimental entry separate.
