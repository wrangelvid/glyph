# Package reference: `@pmndrs/glyph-tres-playground`

This private Vite application proves the public `@pmndrs/glyph/vue` adapter inside a TresJS `<TresCanvas>`. It reuses
the checked Inter and Font Awesome GLBs owned by `@pmndrs/glyph-examples` rather than baking its own assets.

`App.vue` creates Three's `WebGPURenderer` through the `renderer` prop, keeps TresJS in `always` render mode because the
backdrop animates every frame, and renders HTML controls for the raster format and the greeting text. `Scene.vue` runs
inside the canvas: it places a perspective camera at the distance where one world unit at z = 0 is one CSS pixel of the
Tres `sizes`, loads the Latin and icon fonts through `useBitmap`, `useMsdf`, and `useSlug`, renders one keyed greeting
`<Text>` whose nested `<Text>` binds the globe glyph to the icon font, and batches three Slug labels in a `<TextGroup>`.
The greeting and the labels share one `defineTextMaterial` that composes over each format's canonical shader and sweeps
only a band of the active accent color across the glyphs in screen space; sharing it keeps the Slug greeting in the labels' batch. The scene publishes
its Scene and greeting paragraph to a module the browser probe reads.

`Backdrop.vue` sits behind the text at negative z. Its sky is one unlit `MeshBasicNodeMaterial` plane whose `colorNode`
is a TSL graph over `mx_fractal_noise_float` and the renderer-updated `time` uniform, scaled to overfill the frustum at
its depth. Five `MeshStandardNodeMaterial` icosahedrons are lit by an ambient light and two orbiting point lights with
`decay` 0, one bound to the active format's accent color; a `useLoop` callback rotates the shapes and moves the lights.
Glyph text materials are unlit, so the lights affect only the shapes. Node materials are constructed in script and
passed through `material` props because the Tres catalogue types only the classes exported by `three`.

The Vite `source` condition resolves the adapter from `packages/glyph/src`, so adapter edits reload the playground
without a package build.
The production build emits `font-notices.txt` from the Inter and Font Awesome licenses under the root `benches/fixtures/fonts` directory.

## Commands

```sh
mise exec -- pnpm --filter @pmndrs/glyph-tres-playground dev
mise exec -- pnpm --filter @pmndrs/glyph-tres-playground check
```

The check runs `vue-tsgo` template type checking against the repository TypeScript 7 compiler, lint, formatting, a
production build, and one Vitexec browser probe. The probe clicks each format button and requires the greeting to
commit with ten Latin glyphs and one icon across two resource-partitioned draws, next to the label group's single
batched draw, then requires the `backdrop` group to be mounted. Backdrop meshes carry no glyph run metadata, so they
never count toward those draws.
