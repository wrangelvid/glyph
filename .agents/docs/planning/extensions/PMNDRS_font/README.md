# PMNDRS_font

## Contributors

- Poimandres text maintainers, Poimandres, [pmndrs/glyph](https://github.com/pmndrs/glyph)

## Status

Draft vendor extension, versions 0 and 1. Version 1 adds optional glyph outlines, and only a font that carries them
declares it; a font without outlines stays version 0, so version 0 consumers still read it.

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 specification.

## Overview

`PMNDRS_font` stores one baked font face for runtime text shaping. It owns a canonical static OpenType shaping payload, authoritative font metrics, deterministic provenance, optional glyph outlines (the source face's own outline tables), and a directory of renderer-specific rasters. Glyph IDs are local to this face and are shared by all attached rasters.

The extension separates shaping from drawing. Shaping yields glyph IDs, UTF-16 clusters, advances, offsets, and flags. Raster packages draw those glyph IDs without duplicating advances or kerning. Bitmap, MTSDF-backed MSDF, and Slug are the companion extensions currently specified by this project, not an exhaustive registry.

Rasters may be embedded in the same GLB, fetched as independent raster GLBs, or supplied by an application resolver. The font identity and raster records are unchanged by that packaging choice.

This extension does not define text strings, paragraph layout, line breaking, raster-module selection policy, or scene nodes.

### Shaping payload

`shaping.bufferView` MUST contain exactly one static, single-face SFNT conforming to profile `opentype-sfnt-harfrust-v0`.

Required tables are `head`, `maxp`, `cmap`, `hhea`, `hmtx`, and `OS/2`. `GDEF`, `GSUB`, `GPOS`, `kern`, `BASE`, `vhea`, `vmtx`, and `VORG` are retained when present. The profile does not fabricate optional tables and excludes outlines, hinting, font-authored raster data, variable-font tables, AAT, Graphite, collections, WOFF, and WOFF2. Retaining vertical-form source data does not enable vertical shaping or paragraph layout.

`fontFunctions` preserves the optional glyph-extents query used by HarfRust fallback positioning after outlines are removed. `glyphExtentsBufferView` contains one dense 8-byte `(xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax)` i16 record per glyph. `glyphExtentsAvailabilityBufferView` contains exactly one bit per glyph, rounded up to a byte; a clear bit makes the adapter return no extents and requires a zeroed record. HarfRust 0.12.0 exposes no contour-point callback, so Anchor Format 2 point records are not serialized.

The exact whitelist, metric policy, checksums, and validation rules are normative in the [V0 shaping contract](../../shaping-data-contract.md) while this extension is incubated in `pmndrs/glyph`.

`shaping.fingerprint` is the lowercase 128-bit MurmurHash3 fingerprint over the length-prefixed SFNT, glyph-extents,
and extents-availability bytes defined by the shaping contract. A companion raster artifact does not repeat it: the
single `fingerprint` each raster extension carries folds it in along with the source, raster key, kind, version, and
glyph metrics that must agree. It identifies compatible bake outputs; it is not a cryptographic integrity claim.

### Metrics

`metrics.glyphCount` MUST equal `maxp.numGlyphs`; `metrics.unitsPerEm` MUST equal `head.unitsPerEm`; and V0 `glyphIdWidth` MUST be `16`.

When `OS/2.fsSelection.USE_TYPO_METRICS` is set, the serialized line metrics come from the OS/2 typographic fields. Otherwise they come from `hhea`. Serialized metrics are authoritative for consumers and MUST agree with that policy.

### Outlines

Version 1 adds an optional `outlines` object. A baker writes it only when asked; its presence is the flag. A font with
`outlines` MUST declare version 1, and a baker SHOULD keep a font without them at version 0 so version 0 consumers still
read it. It carries every glyph's outline for consumers that need glyph geometry independent of any raster, such as
physics colliders or extrusion.

```json
"outlines": {
  "bufferView": 3
}
```

`bufferView` holds the one outline encoding, an SFNT with the face's `head` and `maxp` and exactly one outline source: `glyf` with `loca`, or
`CFF `, copied unchanged from the source face. It follows the shaping payload's canonical layout: sorted tags, 4-byte
table alignment, zero padding, table checksums, and a valid `head.checkSumAdjustment`. `head.unitsPerEm` and
`maxp.numGlyphs` MUST equal the serialized metrics. A baker MUST NOT write `outlines` for a face without an outline
table, and every glyph MUST decode. Consumers decode one glyph at a time.

Consumers draw the unhinted outline at the default instance. The reference consumer returns closed quadratic contours:
TrueType quadratics exactly, a line as the quadratic whose control is its midpoint and that is flagged as a line, and
each CFF cubic as four equal-parameter quadratics. This version does not define CFF2 outlines.

The outline view is a core view, distinct from the shaping views and from every raster's views. It is not part of
`shaping.fingerprint`: baking outlines changes neither the shaping identity nor any raster's compatibility.

### Raster directory

Raster keys MUST be unique within the font. A key is the deterministic 128-bit descriptor fingerprint over the raster kind, companion extension/version, and canonical package-owned descriptor defined by the [raster contract](../../raster-data-contract.md); it is not a caller-authored alias. `kind` is an open identifier owned by the raster module. `extension` names the companion glTF extension that defines its data, and `version` selects that companion contract. Core consumers MUST NOT reject an otherwise valid font merely because the directory contains an unknown optional raster kind. `rasterKey`, `kind`, `extension`, and `version` MUST agree with an attached raster that the consumer elects to load.

An embedded raster is stored at the root `extensions` object in the same GLB. A font MUST declare at most one raster per companion extension: additional strikes or settings belong to that raster's options, not to a second raster. A raster is external only when the caller asks for a split. An external source URI resolves relative to the core GLB and names a self-contained companion; page payloads always travel inside the artifact that declares them and are never separate files. A companion is matched to its core by the `fingerprint` each raster extension carries, so the directory entry restates no identity of its own. When an external source omits `uri`, the application supplies bytes through its resolver.

Companion extensions own a logical raster-page directory. Page payloads always travel inside the artifact that declares them; a page is never independently addressed. Core does not interpret those pages or equate their indexes with GPU binding state.

The top-level glTF `extensionsRequired` array is the sole required-extension mechanism. Raster entries do not duplicate it.

## glTF Schema Updates

The extension adds a `PMNDRS_font` object to the root glTF `extensions` object. It does not modify core properties.

## Known Implementations

- [`pmndrs/glyph`](https://github.com/pmndrs/glyph) — reference implementation in development.

Three Flatland Slug is prior art for baked GLB font delivery but does not implement this extension.
