# Planning concepts

## Product, API, and execution

- [Project brief](project-brief.md) — product intent, merged v0, target v1, and later horizon.
- [Three.js text API](three-api.md) — authoritative `glyph.fontFace()`, `ThreeConfig`, `TextGroup`, and `Text` surface, including roots, font leases, ordering, and render-loop synchronization.
- [Planner-assisted detached glyph slices](detached-glyph-slice.md) — synchronous committed-record copies, independent Three.js `Glyphs` and decoration objects, matrix ownership, and first-frame upload invariants.
- [Glyph integration API](core-api.md) — authoritative application and integrator API for fonts, measurement, GlyphConfig, Codec command data, CommandBufferView, DisplayList, renderer decode, handles, and roots.
- [Session handoff](session-handoff.md) — the decisions, corrections, and open questions from the API hardening session, including why measurement is two calls and what they should be named.
- [Example renderer](example-renderer.md) — why a non-Three consumer exists, what it proves about the public GlyphConfig contract, and how it divides work with the TypeGPU shader subpath.
- [Renderer integration guide](../guides/renderer-integration.md) — how to implement a custom engine through one inferred `GlyphConfig` using the same public contract as Three.
- [TypeGPU-first shader authority](typegpu-first-shader-authority.md) — exploratory package shape and falsifiable proof ladder for sharing complete raster kernels with direct WebGPU hosts, Three.js, and gpucat without changing core.
- [Merged v0 raster and baker plugin guide](raster-baker-plugin.md) — build against the implemented combined runtime/renderer module before the target v1 extraction replaces it.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — system ownership, import boundaries, and runtime flow.
- [External gpucat integration fitness plan](gpucat-integration.md) — public-surface mapping, external-package boundary, ordering/lifecycle plan, and remaining shader-reuse proof for gpucat.
- [Canonical roadmap](../roadmap/roadmap.md) — authoritative implementation order and exit gates.
- [Glyph alpha fast-follow implementation brief](api-alpha-fast-follow.md) — disposable post-merge prompt for the deferred Rust audit and remaining production-review findings; delete it when the accepted work is complete.
- [uikit integration](uikit-integration.md) — third-party retained-layout integration boundary.

## Data and extension contracts

- [Shaping data contract V0](shaping-data-contract.md) — reduced SFNT and Wasm shaping ABI.
- [Raster data contract V0](raster-data-contract.md) — raster records, texture resources, and paging.
- [glTF extension drafts](extensions/index.md) — core and companion extension schemas.
- [glTF registration draft](gltf-extension-registration.md) — proposed Khronos prefix/extension submission.

## Verification and tooling

- [V0 version pins](version-contract.md) — exact toolchain, oracle, schema, validator, ABI, format, and generator versions.
- [Portable font baker implementation evidence](font-baker-implementation.md) — package-owned Rust/Wasm/TypeScript core evidence; roadmap status remains canonical.
- [Wasm allocator experiment](font-baker-allocator.md) — allocator candidates, representative workloads, and selection gate.
- [Benchmark plan](benchmark-plan.md) — benchmark harness and performance evidence.
- [Conformance plan](conformance-plan.md) — correctness oracles and acceptance gates.
- [Tooling fixtures](tooling-fixtures.md) — reproducible sources, goldens, and validators.
- [Autoresearch protocol](autoresearch.md) — controlled optimization workflow.
- [Untrusted-resource validation library admission](untrusted-validation-research.md) — measured hand-validator, Zod Mini, Valibot, Ajv standalone, and TypeBox comparison.

## Shaping research

- [Shaping compilation and execution research](shaping-compilation-research.md) — closed-corpus baking, semantic bytecode, per-font CPU/Wasm specialization, and WebGPU execution research.
- [Language-aware font units and physical bitmap strikes](language-and-strike-bundles.md) — coverage-first language delivery, CJK units, DPR selection, and independent strike residency.
- [Responsive editorial flow and mixed-raster composition](editorial-flow-layout.md) — research motivation, Pretext comparison, and benchmark concept for post-v1 editorial flow; implementation is owned by the fragment-relative reflow plan.
- [Fragment-relative reflow and LayoutRun placement](fragment-relative-reflow.md) — active Milestone 12 implementation and proof plan for stable run placement, polygon exclusions, projected objects, and same-source drop caps.
- [Paragraph-scoped preparation and synchronous layout queries](paragraph-query-preparation.md) — one-paragraph
  prepare/query, retained candidate adoption, and why it needs no third full buffer.

## Rendering analysis

- [Adaptive dirty-range uploads](dirty-range-upload-research.md) — three-flatland comparison, existing Rust upload-cost
  model, backend behavior, remaining per-buffer work, and measurement gate.
- [MTSDF generation research](mtsdf-generation-research.md) — primary literature, implementation/license survey, owned Rust boundary, and data-oriented optimization gates.
- [Grayscale bitmap hinting research](bitmap-hinting-research.md) — native pixel placement, hinted strikes, and four-phase grayscale packing gates.
- [Renderer capabilities](renderer-capabilities.md) — feature matrix and developer guidance.
- [Implementation difficulty](implementation-difficulty.md) — relative correctness and performance effort.
- [Payload budget](payload-budget.md) — serialized, decoded, and resident cost model.
- [Shaper and baker Wasm size reduction](wasm-size-reduction.md) — measured byte attribution for the distributed Wasm artifacts, the remaining levers, and the staged-table delivery model that keeps one runtime.
- [GPU compression and Rust container ownership](gpu-compression.md) — transport/GPU compression constraints plus the GLB/KTX2 serializer decision.
- [Slug audit](slug-audit.md) — prior-art findings and implementation disposition.

## Governance

- [Decisions](decisions/) — one file per decision since D-372; list with `docs:list -- decision`.
- [Decision register](decision-register.md) — frozen D-001–D-372 architectural decision status.
- [Architecture decision records](decisions/0001-package-runtime-boundaries.md) — accepted rationale grouped by package/runtime, shaping/identity, raster/container, and verification/optimization boundaries.
- [Open questions](open-questions.md) — unresolved decisions and required experiments.
